CHAPTER 1
Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he
hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another,he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret,in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.
It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the
blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one handand a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot)propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of hiseagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for somethingthat would help him write his essay, "Witch Burning in the FourteenthCentury Was Completely Pointless discuss."
The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed
his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closerto the book, and read:
Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly
afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burninghad no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basicFlame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoyinga gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed beingburned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less thanfortyseven times in various disguises.
Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow
for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully heunscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write,pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleysheard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he'dprobably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for therest of the summer.
The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that
Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and2their son, Dudley, were Harry's only living relatives. They were
Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry'sdead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were nevermentioned under the Dursleys' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and UncleVernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible,they would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, theyhad been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone findingout that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts Schoolof Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to lockaway Harry's spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start ofthe summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors.
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,
because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work.One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, wasfor Harry's least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would bedelighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harryhad therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. WhileUncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the frontgarden to admire Uncle Vernon's new company car (in very loud voices, sothat the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had creptdownstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbedsome of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn'tleave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that hewas studying magic by night.
Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at
the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, allbecause he'd received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one weekinto the school vacation.
Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry's best friends at Hogwarts, came from
a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harrydidn't, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily, it hadbeen Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.
"Vernon Dursley speaking."Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard
Ron's voice answer.3"HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I -- WANT -- TO -- TALK -- TO --
HARRY-- POTTER!"
Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver
a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingledfury and alarm.
"WHO IS THIS?" he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. "WHO ARE
YOU?"
"RON -- WEASLEY!" Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were
speaking from opposite ends of a football field. "I'M -- A -- FRIEND --OF -- HARRY'S -- FROM -- SCHOOL --"
Uncle Vernon's small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to
the spot.
"THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!" he roared, now holding the receiver
atarm's length, as though frightened it might explode. "I DON'T KNOW WHATSCHOOL YOURE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN!DON'T YOU COME NEARMY FAMILY!"
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a
poisonous spider.
The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever."HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE -- PEOPLE LIKE
YOU!" UncleVernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that he'd gotten Harry into trouble, because he
hadn't called again. Harry's other best friend from Hogwarts, HermioneGranger, hadn't been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron hadwarned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, thecleverest witch in Harry's year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well4how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to
say that she went to Hogwarts.
So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long
weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the lastone. There was just one very small improvement -- after swearing that hewouldn't use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had beenallowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given inbecause of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all thetime.
Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen
again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant,grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late,Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he'd finishthis essay tomorrow night....
He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from
under his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill,and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loosefloorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and checked thetime on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.
It was one o'clock in the morning. Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt. He
had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.
Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward
to his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in his life. TheDursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had noreason to suppose they would remember this one.
Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig's large, empty cage, to
the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant onhis face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absentfor two nights now. Harry wasn't worried about her: she'd been gone thislong before. But he hoped she'd be back soon -- she was the only livingcreature in this house who didn't flinch at the sight of him.
Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few
inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it5always had been -- stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes
behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearlyvisible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt oflightning.
Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most
extraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for tenyears, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry's parents,because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had beenmurdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years,Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing morethan a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort's curse, instead of killinghim, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort hadfled....
But Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Remembering their
last meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he waslucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.
He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaringback to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise.
Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harryrealized what he was seeing.
Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment,
was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry'sdirection. He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For asplit second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wonderingwhether to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over oneof the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was,leapt aside.
Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third,
which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft flump onHarry's bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled rightover and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once -- his name was Errol, and
he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the6cords around Errol's legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol
to Hedwig's cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot ofthanks, and began to gulp some water.
Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy
female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and lookedextremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip withher beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to joinErrol.
Harry didn't recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew
at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package,it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relievedthis owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretchedits wings, and took off through the window into the night.
Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol's package, ripped off the
brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his firstever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope.Two pieces of paper fell out -- a letter and a newspaper clipping.
The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily
Prophet, because the people in the black-and-white picture were moving.Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:
MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZEArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the
Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize GalleonDraw.
A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, "We will be spending the
gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works asa curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank."
The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the
start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasleychildren currently attend.
Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face7as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in
front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tail, balding Mr.Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black-and-whitepicture didn't show it) with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle ofthe picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, onhis shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny.
Harry couldn't think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold
more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor. He pickedup Ron's letter and unfolded it.
Dear Harry,Happy birthday!Look, I' really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles
didn't give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn'thave shouted.
It's amazing here in Egypt. Bill's taken us around all the tombs and you
wouldn't believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mumwouldn't let Ginny come in the last one. There were all these mutantskeletons in there, of Muggles who'd broken in and grown extra heads andstuff.
I couldn't believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven hundred
galleons! Most of it's gone on this trip, but they're going to buy me anew wand for next year.
Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron's old wand had
snapped. It had happened when the car the two of them had been flying toHogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds.
We'll be back about a week before term starts and we'll be going up to
London to get my wand and our new books. Any chance of meeting youthere?
Don't let the Muggles get you down!Try and come to London,8Ron
P.S. Percy's Head Boy. He got the letter last week.Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his seventh and
final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He had pinned hisHead Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, hishorn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.
Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked
like a miniature glass spinning top. There was another note from Ronbeneath it.
Harry -- this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there's someone untrustworthy
around, it's supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it's rubbish soldfor wizard tourists and isn't reliable, because it kept lighting up atdinner last night. But he didn't realize Fred and George had put beetlesin his soup.
Bye --RonHarry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it stood
quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of hisclock. He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up theparcel Hedwig had brought.
Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter,
this time from Hermione.
Dear Harry,Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I
do hope you're all right.
I'm on holiday in France at the moment and I didn't know how I was going
to send this to you -- what if they'd opened it at customs? -- but thenHedwig turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got something for9your birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there
was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I've been getting itdelivered; it's so good to keep up with what's going on in the wizardingworld), Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a week ago? I bethe's learning loads. I'm really jealous -- the ancient Egyptian wizardswere fascinating.
There's some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too. I've
rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the thingsI've found out, I hope it's not too long -- it's two rolls of parchmentmore than Professor Binns asked for.
Ron says he's going to be in London in the last week of the holidays.
Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hopeyou can. If not, I'll see you on the Hogwarts Express on Septemberfirst!
Love from HermioneP.S. Ron says Percy's Head Boy. I'll bet Percy's really pleased Ron
doesn't seem too happy about it
Harry laughed as he put Herrmone's letter aside and picked up her
present. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be alarge book full of very difficult spells -- but it wasn't. His heartgave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek blackleather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading BroomstickServicing Kit.
"Wow, Hermione!" Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.There was a large jar of Fleetwood's High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair
of gleaming silver Tall-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip onyour broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-YourselfBroomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world -- highlydangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened tobe a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a10century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry's
most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was fromHagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper andglimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap itproperly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside itsnapped loudly -- as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything dangerous
on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn't have a normal person's view of whatwas dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buyvicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragoneggs into his cabin.
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached
for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, andraised it over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of thewrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.
And out fell -- a book. Harry just had time to register its handsome
green cover, emblazoned with the golden title The Monster Book ofMonsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways alongthe bed like some weird crab.
"Uh-oh," Harry muttered.The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly
across the room. Harry followed it stealthily. The book was hiding inthe dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fastasleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it.
"Ouch!"The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still
scuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward,and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in theroom next door.11Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling
book tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulledout a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Bookshuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw itdown on the bed and reached for Hagrid's card.
Dear Harry,Happy Birthday!Think you might find this useful for next year. Won't say no more here.
Tell you when I see you. Hope the Muggles are treating you right.
All the best,HagridIt struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come
in useful, but he put Hagrid's card up next to Ron's and Hermione's,grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter fromHogwarts left.
Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the
envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:
Dear Mr. Potter,Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first.
The Hogwarts Express will leave ftom King's Cross station, platform nineand three-quarters, at eleven o'clock.
Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain
weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent orguardian to sign.
A list of books for next year is enclosed. Yours sincerely,Professor M. McGonagallDeputy Headmistress12Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no
longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends;he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set footthere. But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or AuntPetunia to sign the form?
He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o'clock in the
morning.
Deciding that he'd worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, Harry
got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the charthe'd made for himself, counting down the days left until his return toHogwarts. Then he took off his glasses and lay down, eyes open, facinghis three birthday cards.
Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just
like everyone else -- glad, for the first time in his life, that it washis birthday.
CHAPTER 2
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys
already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-newtelevision, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who hadbeen complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and thetelevision in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer inthe kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his fivechins wobbling as he ate continually.
Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with
very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happybirthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harryenter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helpedhimself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on thetelevision, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict:
"... The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A13special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be
reported immediately."
"No need to tell us he's no good," snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over
the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. "Look at the state of him, thefilthy layabout! Look at his hair!"
He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always
been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man onthe television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted,elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.
The reporter had reappeared."The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today --""Hang on!" barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. "You
didn't tell us where that maniac's escaped from! \What use is that?Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!"
Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered
intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simplylove to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiestwoman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring,law-abiding neighbors.
"When will they learn," said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his
large purple fist, "that hanging's the only way to deal with thesepeople?"
"Very true," said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door's
runner beans.
Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, "I'd
better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge's train gets in at ten."
Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing
Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.
"Aunt Marge?" he blurted out. "Sh -- she's not coming here, is she?"14Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon's sister. Even though she was not a blood
relative of Harry's (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia's sister), hehad been forced to call her "Aunt" all his life. Aunt Marge lived in thecountry, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. Shedidn't often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn't bear to leaveher precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly inHarry's mind.
At Dudley's fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around
the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley atmusical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas witha computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. Onher last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry hadaccidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chasedHarry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused tocall him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident stillbrought tears of laughter to Dudley's eyes.
"Marge'll be here for a week," Uncle Vernon snarled, 11 and while we're
on the subject" -- he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry -- "weneed to get a few things straight before I go and collect her."
Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching Harry
being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley's favorite form ofentertainment.
"Firstly," growled Uncle Vernon, "you'll keep a civil tongue in your
head when you're talking to Marge."
"All right," said Harry bitterly, "if she does when she's talking to me."Secondly," said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry's
reply, "as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don'twant any -- any funny stuff while she's here.
You behave yourself, got me?""I will if she does," said Harry through gritted teeth.15"And thirdly," said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his
great purple face, "we've told Marge you attend St. Brutus's SecureCenter for Incurably Criminal Boys."
"What?" Harry yelled."And you'll be sticking to that story, boy, or there'll be trouble, spat
Uncle Vernon.
Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon,
hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit -- itwas the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him,including that pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.
"Well, Petunia," said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, "I'll
be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?"
"No," said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now
that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.
"Duddy's got to make himself smart for his auntie," said Aunt Petunia,
smoothing Dudley's thick blond hair. "Mummy's bought him a lovely newbow tie."
Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. "See you in a bit,
then," he said, and he left the kitchen.
Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden
idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followedUncle Vernon to the front door.
Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat."I'm not taking you," he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him."Like I wanted to come," said Harry coldly. "I want to ask you
something."
Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.16"Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village
sometimes," said Harry.
"So?" snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the
door.
"I need you to sign the permission form," said Harry in a rush."And why should I do that?" sneered Uncle Vernon."Well," said Harry, choosing his words carefully, "it'll be hard work,
pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits --"
"St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!" bellowed Uncle
Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in UncleVernon's voice.
"Exactly," said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon's large,
purple face. "It's a lot to remember. I'll have to make it soundconvincing, won't I? What if I accidentally let something slip?"
"You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?" roared Uncle
Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood hisground.
"Knocking the stuffing out of me won't make Aunt Marge forget what I
could tell her," he said grimly.
Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce."But if you sign my permission form," Harry went on quickly, "I swear
I'll remember where I'm supposed to go to school, and I'll act like aMug -- like I'm normal and everything."
Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his
teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.
"Right," he snapped finally. "I shall monitor your behavior carefully
during Marge's visit. If, at the end of it, you've toed the line andkept to the story, I'll sign your ruddy form."17He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard
that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.
Harry didn't return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his
bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he'd better startnow. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthdaycards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then hewent to Hedwig's cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwigwere both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked themboth awake.
"Hedwig," he said gloomily, "you're going to have to clear off for a
week. Go with Errol. Ron'll look after you. I'll write him a note,explaining. And don't look at me like that" -- Hedwig's large amber eyeswere reproachful -- "it's not my fault. It's the only way I'll beallowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione."
Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her
leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feelingthoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.
But Harry didn't have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia
was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready towelcome their guest.
"Do something about your hair!" Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the
hall.
Harry couldn't see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt
Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the happier shewould be.
All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon's car
pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors andfootsteps on the garden path.
"Get the door!" Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.18On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon:
large, beefy, and purple- faced, she even had a mustache, though not asbushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tuckedunder the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog.
"Where's my Dudders?" roared Aunt Marge. "Where's my neffy-poo?"Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his
fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrustthe suitcase into Harry's stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seizedDudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek.
Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge's hugs
because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart,Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.
"Petunia!" shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a
hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Margebumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia's bony cheekbone.
Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door."Tea, Marge?" he said. "And what will Ripper take?""Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer," said Aunt Marge as they all
proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with thesuitcase. But Harry wasn't complaining; any excuse not to be with AuntMarge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into thespare bedroom, taking as long as he could.
By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied
with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner.Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool fleckedher clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.
"Who's looking after the other dogs, Marge?" Uncle Vernon asked."Oh, I've got Colonel Fubster managing them," boomed Aunt Marge. "He's
retired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn't leave19poor old Ripper. He pines if he's away from me."
Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt
Marge's attention to Harry for the first time.
"So!" she barked. "Still here, are you?""Yes," said Harry."Don't you say yes' in that ungrateful tone," Aunt Marge growled. "It's
damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn't have done itmyself. You'd have gone straight to an orphanage if you'd been dumped onmy doorstep."
Harry was bursting to say that he'd rather live in an orphanage than
with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him. Heforced his face into a painful smile.
"Don't you smirk at me!" boomed Aunt Marge. "I can see you haven't
improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some mannersinto you." She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said,"Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?"
"St. Brutus's," said Uncle Vernon promptly. "It's a first-rate
institution for hopeless cases."
"I see," said Aunt Marge. "Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?"
she barked across the table.
"Er --"Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge's back."Yes," said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly,
he added, "all the time."
"Excellent," said Aunt Marge. "I won't have this namby-pamby,
wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A goodthrashing is what's needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Haveyou been beaten often?"20"Oh, yeah," said Harry, "loads of times."
Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes."I still don't like your tone, boy," she said. "If you can speak of your
beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren't hitting you hardenough. Petunia, I'd write if I were you. Make it clear that you approvethe use of extreme force in this boy's case."
Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain;
in any case, he changed the subject abruptly.
"Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner,
eh?"
As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself
thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. UncleVernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of theirway, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the otherhand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boomout suggestions for his improvement. She delighted in comparing Harrywith Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presentswhile glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn't got apresent too. She also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harrysuch an unsatisfactory person.
"You mustn't blame yourself for the way the boy's turned out, Vernon,"
she said over lunch on the third day. "If there's something rotten onthe inside, there's nothing anyone can do about it."
Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face
was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, he told himselfThink about Hogsmeade. Don't say anything. Don't rise
Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine."It's one of the basic rules of breeding," she said. "You see it all the
time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll besomething wrong with the pup --"21At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her
hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputteredand blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.
"Marge!" squealed Aunt Petunia. "Marge, are you all right?""Not to worry," grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with her napkin.
"Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster'sthe other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip..."
But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry
suspiciously, so he decided he'd better skip dessert and escape from thetable as soon as he could.
Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply It had
been a long time since he'd lost control and made something explode. Hecouldn't afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn't theonly thing at stake -- if he carried on like that, he'd be in troublewith the Ministry of Magic.
Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law
to do magic outside school. His record wasn't exactly clean either. Onlylast summer he'd gotten an official warning that had stated quiteclearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive,Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts.
He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the
way.
Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about
his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started onhim. This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look,because Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentallysubnormal.
At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge's stay arrived. Aunt
Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottlesof wine. They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without asingle mention of Harry's faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle22Vernon bored them A with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making
company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out abottle of brandy.
"Can I tempt you, Marge?"Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was very
red.
"Just a small one, then," she chuckled. "A bit more than that... and a
bit more... that's the ticket."
Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping
coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted todisappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon's angry little eyesand knew he would have to sit it out.
"Aah," said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy
glass back down. "Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-upfor me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after...." She burpedrichly and patted her great tweed stomach. "Pardon me. But I do like tosee a healthy-sized boy," she went on, winking at Dudley. "You'll be aproper-sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I'll have a spot morebrandy, Vernon...."
"Now, this one here --"She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook,
he thought quickly.
"This one's got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I
had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was-Weak. Underbred."
Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure
Reluctant Reversers. "It all comes down to blood, as I was saying theother day.
Bad blood will out. Now, I'm saying nothing against your family,
Petunia" she patted Aunt Petunia's bony hand with her shovellike one23"but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then
she ran off with a wastrel and here's the result right in front of us."
Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your
broom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn't remember what camenext. Aunt Marge's voice seemed to be boring into him like one of UncleVernon's drills.
"This Potter, 5) said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and
splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, "you never toldme what he did?"
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had
even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents.
"He -- didn't work," said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry.
"Unemployed."
"As I expected!" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and
wiping her chin on her sleeve. "A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazyscrounger who --"
"He was not," said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was
shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life.
"MORE BRANDY!" yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied
the bottle into Aunt Marge's glass. "You, boy," he snarled at Harry. "Goto bed, go on --"
"No, Vernon," hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot
eyes fixed on Harry's. "Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, areyou? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect)--"
'They didn't die in a car crash!" said Harry, who found himself on his
feet.
"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a
burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!" screamed Aunt Marge,swelling with fury. "You are an insolent, ungrateful little --"24But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as
though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling withinexpressible anger -- but the swelling didn't stop. Her great red facestarted to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched tootightly for speech -- next second, several buttons had just burst fromher tweed jacket and pinged off the walls -- she was inflating like amonstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband,each of her fingers blowing up like a salami --
"MARGE!" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge's
whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She wasentirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and herhands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, makingapoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barkingmadly.
"NOOOOOOO!"Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge's feet and tried to pull her down
again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later,Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon's leg.
Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading
for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magicallyopen as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the frontdoor. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching upthe loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books andbirthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig's empty cage, anddashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out ofthe dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.
"COME BACK IN HERE!" he bellowed. "COME BACK AND PUT HER
RIGHT!"
But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open,
pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.
"She deserved it," Harry said, breathing very fast. "She deserved what
she got. You keep away from me."25He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.
"I'm going," Harry said. "I've had enough."And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving
his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig's cage under his arm.
CHAPTER 3
Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in
Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He satquite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the franticthumping of his heart.
But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook
him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worsefix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, withabsolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just doneserious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled fromHogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of UnderageWizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representativesweren't swooping down on him where he sat.
Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent.What, was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he
simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron andHermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure that, criminalor not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were bothabroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them.
He didn't have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold
in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortunehis parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts WizardingBank in London. He'd never be able to drag his trunk all the way toLondon. Unless...26He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If
he was already expelled (his heart was. now thumping painfully fast), abit more magic couldn't hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he hadinherited from his father -- what if he bewitched the trunk to make itfeather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak,and flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of hisvault and... begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect,but he couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he'd find himself trying toexplain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with atrunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.
Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for
the Invisibility Cloak - but before he had found it, he straightened upsuddenly, looking around him once more.
A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was
being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lightsshone from any of the large square houses.
He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more,
his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it:someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garageand the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If onlyit would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or --something else.
"Lumos," Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand,
almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and thepebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage doorgleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulkingoutline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.
Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand
flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and helanded, hard, in the gutter --
There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his
eyes against a sudden blinding light --
With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second27later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt
exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry sawwhen he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, whichhad appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelledThe Knight Bus.
For a Split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his
fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus andbegan to speak loudly to the night.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch
or wizard. just stick out your wand hand, step on board) and we can takeyou anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will beyour conductor this eve --"
The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of "Harry, who
was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again andscrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only afew years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large,protruding ears and quite a few pimples.
"What were you doin' down there?" said Stan, dropping his professional
manner.
"Fell over," said Harry."'Choo fall over for?" sniggered Stan."I didn't do it on purpose," said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in
his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall wasbleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turnedaround quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence.The Knight Bus's headlamps were flooding it with light, and it wasempty.
"'Choo lookin' at?" said Stan."There was a big black thing," said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the
gap. "Like a dog... but massive..."28He looked a-round at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling
of unease, Harry saw Stan's eyes move to the scar on Harry's forehead.
"Woss that on your 'ead?" said Stan abruptly."Nothing," said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the
Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn't want to make it tooeasy for them.
"Woss your name?" Stan persisted."Neville Longbottom," said Harry, saying the first name that came into
his head. "So -- so this bus," he went on quickly, hoping to distractStan, "did you say it goes anywhere?"
"Yep," said Stan proudly, "anywhere you like, long's it's on land. Can't
do nuffink underwater. 'Ere," he said, looking suspicious again, ,Youdid flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand 'and, dincha?"
"Yes," said Harry quickly. "Listen, how much would it be to get to
London?"
"Eleven Sickles," said Stan, "but for fifteen you get 'or chocolate, and
for fifteen you get an 'ot water bottle an' a toofbrush in the color ofyour choice."
Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and
shoved some gold into Stan's hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk,with Hedwig's cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus.
There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside
the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed,illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at therear of the bus muttered, "Not now, thanks, I'm pickling some slugs" androlled over in his sleep.
"You 'ave this one," Stan whispered, shoving Harry's trunk under the bed
right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of thesteering wheel. "This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This ,is NevilleLongbottom, Ern. "29Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to
Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.
"Take 'er away, Ern," said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to
Ernie's.
There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found
himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus.Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw thatthey were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan waswatching Harry's stunned face with great enjoyment.
"This is where we was before you flagged us down," he said. "Where are
we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?"
"Ar," said Ernie."How come the Muggles don't hear the bus?" said Harry."Them!" said Stan contemptuously. "Don' listen properly, do they? Don'
look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don'."
"Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan," said Ern. "We'll be in Abergavenny
in a minute."
Stan passed Harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase.
Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous.Ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. TheKnight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn't hit anything; linesof lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as itapproached and back into position once it had passed.
Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in
a traveling cloak.
"'Ere you go, Madam Marsh," said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the
brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. MadamMarsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps.Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was30another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane,
trees leaping out of the way.
Harry wouldn't have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on
a bus that didn't keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at atime. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going tohappen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Margeoff the ceiling yet.
Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with
his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced manwith long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. Helooked strangely familiar.
"That man!" Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. "He was on
the Muggle news!"
Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled."Sirius Black," he said, nodding. "'Course 'e was on the Muggle news,
Neville, where you been?"
He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry's face,
removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.
"You oughta read the papers more, Neville."Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:BLACK STILL AT LARGESirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in
Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magicconfirmed today.
"We are doing all we can to recapture Black," said the Minister of
Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, "and we beg the magical communityto remain calm."
Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International31Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the
crisis.
"Well, really, I had to, don't you know," said an irritable Fudge.
"Black is mad. He's a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle.I have the Prime Minister's assurance that he will not breathe a word ofBlack's true identity to anyone. And let's face it-who'd believe him ifhe did?"
While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of
metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical communitylives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Blackmurdered thirteen people with a single curse.
Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of
the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but hehad seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes,and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.
"Scary-lookin' fing, inee?" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read."He murdered thirteen people?" said Harry, handing the page back to
Stan, "with one curse?"
"Yep," said Stan, "in front of witnesses an' all. Broad daylight. Big
trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?"
"Ar," said Ern darkly.Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look
at Harry.
"Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-'Oo," he said."What, Voldemort?" said Harry, without thinking.Even Stan's pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard
that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.
"You outta your tree?" yelped Stan. "'Choo say 'is name for?"32"Sorry," said Harry hastily. "Sorry, I -- I forgot --"
"Forgot!" said Stan weakly. "Blimey, my 'eart's goin' that fast ...""So -- so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?" Harry prompted
apologetically.
"Yeah," said Stan, still rubbing his chest. "Yeah, that's right. Very
close to You-Know-'Oo, they say. Anyway, when little 'Arry Potter gotthe better of You-Know-'Oo --"
Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again."-- all You-Know-'Oo's supporters was tracked down, wasn't they, Ern?
Most of 'em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-'Oo gone, and they camequiet. But not Sirius Black. I 'eard he thought 'e'd besecond-in-command once You-Know-'Oo 'ad taken over.
"Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles
an' Black took out 'is wand and 'e blasted 'alf the street apart, an' awizard got it, an' so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. 'Orrible,eh? An' you know what Black did then?" Stan continued in a dramaticwhisper.
"What?" said Harry."Laughed," said Stan. "Jus' stood there an' laughed. An' when
reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, I 'e went wiv emquiet as anyfink, still laughing 'is 'ead off. 'Cos 'e's mad, inee, Ern?Inee mad?"
"If he weren't when he went to Azkaban, he will be now," said Ern in his
slow voice. "I'd blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serveshim right, mind you ... after what he did...."
"They 'ad a job coverin' it up, din' they, Ern?" Stan said. "'Ole street
blown up an' all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ad 'appened,Ern?"33"Gas explosion," grunted Ernie.
"An' now 'e's out," said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of
Black's gaunt face again. "Never been a breakout from Azkaban before,'as there, Ern? Beats me 'ow 'e did it. Frightenin', eh? Mind, I don'tfancy 'is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?"
Ernie suddenly shivered."Talk about summat else, Stan, there's a good lad. Them Azkaban guards
give me the collywobbles."
Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window
of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn't help imaginingwhat Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights' time.
"'Ear about that 'Arry Potter? Blew up 'is aunt! We 'ad 'im 'ere on the
Knight Bus, di'n't we, Ern? 'E was tryin' I to run for it...."
He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating
Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn't know anythingabout the wizard prison, though everyone he'd ever heard speak of it didso in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spenttwo months there only last year. Harry wouldn't soon forget the look ofterror on Hagrid's face when he had been told where he was going, andHagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.
The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and
wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless andmiserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harryhad paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry's pillow whenthe bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizardsand witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upperfloors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.
Finally, Harry was the only passenger left."Right then, Neville," said Stan, clapping his hands, where abouts in
London?"34"Diagon Alley," said Harry.
"Righto," said Stan. "'Old tight, then."BANG.They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched
buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus's way.The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple ofhours, go to Gringotts the. moment it opened, then set off -- where, hedidn't know.
Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front
of a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which laythe magical entrance to Diagon Alley.
"Thanks," Harry said to Ern.He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig's
cage onto the pavement.
"Well," said Harry. "'Bye then!"But Stan wasn't paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the
bus) he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron."There you are, Harry," said a voice.
Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same
time, Stan shouted, "Blimey! Ern, come 'ere! Come 'ere I"
Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a
bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach -- he had walked right intoCornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself.
Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them."What didja call Neville, Minister?" he said excitedly.Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and
exhausted.35"Neville?" he repeated, frowning. "This is Harry Potter."
"I knew it!" Stan shouted gleefully. "Ern! Ern! Guess 'oo Neville is,
Ern! 'E's 'Arry Potter! I can see 'is scar!"
"Yes," said Fudge testily, "well, I'm very glad the Knight Bus picked
Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now..."
Fudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder, and Harry found
himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing alantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, thewizened, toothless landlord.
"You've got him, Minister!" said Tom. "Will you be wanting anything?
Beer? Brandy?"
"Perhaps a pot of tea," said Fudge, who still hadn't let go of Harry.There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern
appeared, carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking aroundexcitedly.
"'Ow come you di'n't tell us 'oo you are, eh, Neville?" said Stan,
beaming at Harry, while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly overStan's shoulder.
"And a private parlor, please, Tom," said Fudge pointedly.`Bye," Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward
the passage that led from the bar.
"'Bye, Neville!" called Stan.Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and
then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst intolife in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.
"Sit down, Harry," said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.36Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow
of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside,then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat downopposite Harry.
"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic."Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but
as he had been wearing his father's Invisibility Cloak at the time,Fudge wasn't to know that.
Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and
bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a tablebetween Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behindhim.
"Well, Harry," said Fudge, pouring out tea, "you've had us all in a
right flap, I don't mind telling you. Running away from your aunt anduncle's house like that! I'd started to think... but you're safe, andthat's what matters."
Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry."Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then... You will be pleased
to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of MissMarjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic ReversalDepartment were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursleyhas been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has norecollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done."
Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle
surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe his ears,opened his mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closedit again.
"Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?" said
Fudge. "Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, butthey are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay atHogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays."37Harry unstuck his throat.
"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays," he
said, "and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive."
"Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,"
said Fudge in a worried tone. "They are your family, after all, and I'msure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down."
It didn't occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to
hear what was going to happen to him now.
"So all that remains," said Fudge, now buttering himself a second
crumpet, "is to decide where you're going to spend the last two weeks ofyour vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and
"Hang on," blurted Harry. "What about my punishment?"Fudge blinked. "Punishment?""I broke the law!" Harry said. "The Decree for the Restriction of
Underage Wizardry!"
"Oh, my dear boy, we're not going to punish you for a little thing like
that!" cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. "It was an accident!We don't send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!"
But this didn't tally at all with Harry's past dealings with the
Ministry of Magic.
"Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a
pudding in my uncle's house!" he told Fudge, frowning. "The Ministry ofMagic said I'd be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magicthere!"
Unless Harry's eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking
awkward.
"Circumstances change, Harry... We have to take into account... in the
present climate... Surely you don't want to be expelled?"38"Of course I don't," said Harry.
"Well then, what's A the fuss about?" laughed Fudge. "Now, have a
crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom's got a room for you."
Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. There was
something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him atthe Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he'd done? And nowHarry came to think of it, surely it wasn't usual for the Minister ofMagic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?
Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper."Room eleven's free, Harry," said Fudge. "I think you'll be very
comfortable. just one thing, and I'm sure you'll understand... I don'twant you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to DiagonAlley. And you're to be back here before dark each night. Sure you'llunderstand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me."
"Okay," said Harry slowly, "but why?""Don't want to lose you again, do we?" said Fudge with a hearty laugh.
"No, no... best we know where you are.... I mean..."
Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak."Well, I'll be off, plenty to do, you know..."Have you had any luck with Black yet?" Harry asked.Fudge's finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak."What's that? Oh, you've heard -- well, no, not yet, but it's only a
matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed... and they areangrier than I've ever seen them."
Fudge shuddered slightly."So, I'll say good-bye."39He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.
"Er -- Minister? Can I ask you something?""Certainly," said Fudge with a smile."Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my
aunt and uncle didn't sign the permission form. D'you think you could--?"
Fudge was looking uncomfortable."Ah," he said. "No, no, I'm very sorry, Harry, but as I'm not your
parent or guardian --"
"But you I re the Minister of Magic," said Harry eagerly. "If you gave
me permission
"No, I'm sorry, Harry, but rules are rules," said Fudge flatly.'Perhaps You'll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think
it's best if you don't... yes... well, I'll be off Enjoy your stay,Harry."
And with a last smile and shake of Harry's hand, Fudge left the room.
Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry.
"If you'll follow me, Mr. Potter," he said, "I've already taken your
things up..."
Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass
number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him.
Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak
furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of thewardrobe -
"Hedwig!" Harry gasped.40The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry's arm.
"Very smart owl you've got there, chuckled Tom. "Arrived about five
minutes after you did. If there's anything you need, Mr. Potter, don'thesitate to ask."
He gave another bow and left.Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig.
The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blueto cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harrycould hardly believe that he'd left Privet Drive only a few hours ago,that he wasn't expelled, and that he was now facing two completelyDursley-free weeks.
"It's been a very weird night, Hedwig," he yawned.And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows
and fell asleep.
CHAPTER 4
It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never
before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever hefancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was inDiagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the mostfascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to breakhis word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.
Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked
watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up fora day's shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latestarticle in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs;and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate ofraw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,
tap the third brick from the left above the trash bit,, and stand back41as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the
brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners wereshowing one another their purchases ( " it , s a lunascope, old boy --no more messing around with moon charts, see?") or else discussing thecase of Sirius Black ("personalty, I won't let any of the children outalone until he's back in Azkaban"). Harry didn't have to do his homeworkunder the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the brightsunshine outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all hisessays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apartfrom knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry freesundaes every half an hour.
Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver
Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had toexercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. Hehad to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts,and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, tostop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (awizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt anasty-smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose apoint). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of thegalaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had totake another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry'sresolution most appeared in his favorite shop, Quality QuidditchSupplies, a week after he'd arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.
Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged
his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizardsuntil he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the mostmagnificent broom he had ever seen in his life.
"Just come out -- prototype --" a square-jawed wizard was telling his
companion.
"It's the fastest broom in the world, isn't it, Dad?" squeaked a boy
younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father's arm.
"Irish International Side's Just put in an order for seven of these42beauties!" the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. "And they're
favorites for the World Cup!"
A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign
next to the broom:
** THE FIREBOLT **THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART PACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM-LINED,
SUPERFINEHANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND-HARD POLISH ANDHAND- NUMBEREDWITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLYSELECTED BIRCH TWIGIN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMICPERFECTION, GIVING THEFIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION.THE FIREBOLT HASAN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS ANDINCORPORATES ANUNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.
Price on request... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the
Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his wholelife -- but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nim bus TwoThousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for theFirebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn't ask forthe price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look atthe Firebolt.
There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the
Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as hisschool robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, hevisited Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Mostimportant of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would includethose for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures andDivination.
Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of
the usual display of gold- embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs,43there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred
copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flyingeverywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together infurious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.
Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the
first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required bookfor Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had saidit would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whetherHagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.
As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward
him.
"Hogwarts?" he said abruptly. "Come to get your new books?""Yes," said Harry, "I need --""Get out of the way," said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry
aside. He drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large,knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the MonsterBooks' cage.
"Hang on," said Harry quickly, "I've already got one of those.""Have you?" A look of enormous relief spread over the manager's face.
"Thank heavens for that. I've been bitten five times already thismorning --"
A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had seized a
third and were pulling it apart.
"Stop it! Stop it!" cried the manager, poking the walking stick through
the bars and knocking the books apart. "I'm never stocking them again,never! It's been bedlam! I thought we'd seen the worst when we boughttwo hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility -cost afortune, and we never found them.... Well... is there anything else Ican help you with?"
"Yes," said Harry, looking down his booklist, "I need Unfogging the44Future by Cassandra Vablatsky."
"Ah, starting Divination, are you?" said the manager, stripping off his
gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was acorner devoted to fortune-telling. A small table was stacked withvolumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself AgainstShocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul.
"Here you are,,' said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to
take down a thick, black- bound book. "Unfogging the Future. Very goodguide to all your basic fortune-telling methods - palmistry, crystalballs, bird entrails.
But Harry wasn't listening. His eyes had fallen on another book, which
was among a display on a small table: Death Omens.- What to Do When YouKnow the Worst Is Coming.
"Oh, I wouldn't read that if I were you," said the manager lightly,
looking to see what Harry was staring at. "You'll start seeing deathomens everywhere. It's enough to frighten anyone to death. "
But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a
black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddlyfamiliar...
The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry's hands."Anything else?" he said."Yes," said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog's and dazedly
consulting his booklist. "Er -- I need Intermediate Transfiguration andThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three."
Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new
books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardlynoticing where he was going and bumping into several people.
He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books
onto his bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open andsun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the45unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd
below in Diagon Alley. He caught sight of himself in the mirror over thebasin.
"It can't have been a death omen," he told his reflection defiantly. "I
was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent.... It wasprobably just a stray dog...."
He raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat"You're fighting a losing battle there, dear," said his mirror in a
vvheezy voice.
As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a
sign of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving inDiagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met SeamusFinnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality QuidditchSupplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into thereal Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourishand Blotts. Harry didn't stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaidhis booklist and was being told off by his very formidable-lookinggrandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that he'd pretended to beNeville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic.
Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at
least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He gotup, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was justwondering where he'd have lunch, when someone yelled his name and heturned.
"Harry! HARRY!"They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice
Cream Parlor -- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Her,,one very brown,both waving frantically at him.
"Finally!" said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. "We went to the
Leaky Cauldron, but they said you'd left, and we went to Flourish andBlotts, and Madam Malkin's, and --"46"I got all my school stuff last week," Harry explained. "And how come
You knew I'm staying at the Leaky Cauldron?" "Dad," said Ron simply.
Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have
heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge.
"Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?" said Hermione in a very
serious voice.
"I didn't mean to," said Harry, while Ron roared with laughter. "I just
-- lost control."
"It's not funny, Ron," said Hermione sharply. "Honestly, I'm amazed
Harry wasn't expelled."
"So am I," admitted Harry. "Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be
arrested." He looked at Ron. "Your dad doesn't know why Fudge let meoff, does he?"
"Probably 'cause it's you, isn't it?" shrugged Ron, still chuckling.
"Famous Harry Potter and all that. I'd hate to see what the Ministry'ddo to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they'd have to dig me up first,because Mum would've killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself thisevening. We're staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you cancome to King's Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione's there as well!"
Hermione nodded, beaming. "Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with
all my Hogwarts things."
"Excellent!" said Harry happily. "So, have you got all your new books
and stuff?"
"Look at this," said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and
opening it. "Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing oneunicorn tail-hair. And we've got all our books --" He pointed at a largebag under his chair. "What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistantnearly cried when we said we wanted two."
"What's all that, Hermione?" Harry asked, pointing at not one but three47bulging bags in the chair next to her.
,,Well, I'm taking more new subjects than you, aren't IF' said Hermione.
"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures,Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies --"
"What are you doing Muggle Studies for?" said Ron, rolling his eyes at
Harry. "You're Muggle- born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You alreadyknow all about Muggles!"
"But it'll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of
view," said Hermione earnestly.
"Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?" asked
Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.
"I've still got ten Galleons," she said, checking her purse. "It's my
birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myselfan early birthday present."
"How about a nice book? said Ron innocently."No, I don't think so," said Hermione composedly. "I really want an owl.
I mean, Harry's got Hedwig and you've got Errol --"
"I haven't," said Ron. "Errol's a family owl. All I've got is Scabbers."
He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. "And I want to get him checkedover," he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. "Idon't think Egypt agreed with him."
Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop
to his whiskers.
"There's a magical creature shop just over there," said Harry, who knew
Diagon Alley very well by now. "You could see if they've got anythingfor Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl,"
So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical
Menagerie.48There wasn't much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages.
It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants Of these cages wereall squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind thecounter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts,so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.
A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead
blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell wasglittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowlyup the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changinginto a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise. Then therewere cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funnycustard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, avast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skippinggame using their long, bald tails.
The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter."It's my rat," he told the witch. "He been a bit off-color ever since I
brought him back from Egypt."
"Bang him on the counter," said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black
spectacles out of her pocket.
Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the
cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffledto the wire for a better took.
Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he
had once belonged to Ron's brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next tothe glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.
"Hm," said the witch, picking up Scabbers. "How old is this rat?""Dunno," said Ron. "Quite old. He used to belong to my brother.""What powers does he have?" said the witch, examining Scabbers closely."Er --" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace
of interesting powers. The witchs eyes moved from Scabbers's tattered49left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.
"He's been through the mill, this one," she said."He was like that when Percy gave him to me," said Ron defensively."An ordinary common or garden rat like this can't be expected to live
longer than three years or so," said the witch. "Now, if you werelooking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one ofthese --"
She indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron
muttered, "Show-offs."
"Well, if you Don't want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,"
said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small redbottle.
"Okay," said Ron. "How much -- OUCH!"Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of
the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself,spitting madly, at Scabbers.
"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!" cried the witch, but Scabbers, shot from between
her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and thenscampered for the door.
"Scabbers!" Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him; Harry
followed.
It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge
under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffedthe trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaginghis head.
"What was that?""It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger," said Harry.50"Where's Hermione?"
"Probably getting her owlThey made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn't carrying an owl.Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
"You bought that monster?" said Ron, his mouth hanging open."He's gorgeous, isn't he?" said Hermione, glowing.That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat's ginger fur was
thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its facelooked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into abrick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat waspurring contentedly in Hermione's arms.
"Herinione, that thing nearly scalped me!" said Ron."He didn't mean to, did you, Crookshanks?" said Hermione."And what about Scabbers?" said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. "He needs rest and relaxation! How's he going to get it withthat thing around?"
"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic," said Hermione, slapping
the small red bottle into Ron's hand. "And stop worrying, Crookshankswill be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what's theproblem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he'd been in there for ages;no one wanted him."
"Wonder why," said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky
Cauldron.
They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily prophet."Harry!" he said, smiling as he looked up. "How are you?""Fine, thanks," said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley51with A their shopping.
Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture
of Sirius Black staring up at him.
"They still haven't caught him, then?" he asked."No," said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. "They've pulled us all
off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck sofar."
"Would we get a reward if we caught him?" asked Ron. "It'd be good to
get some more money --"
"Don't be ridiculous, Ron," said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection
looked very strained. "Black's not going to be caught by athirteen-year-old wizard. It's the Azkaban guards who'll get him back,You mark my words."
At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags
and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to starttheir fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and theWeasleys' youngest child and only girl, Ginny.
Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more
heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he hadsaved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very redand muttered "hello" without looking at him. Percy, however, held outhis hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, "Harry.How nice to see you.
"Hello, Percy," said Harry, trying not to laugh.I hope you're well?" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather
like being introduced to the mayor.
"Very well, thanks --""Harry!" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply.
"Simply splendid to see you, old boy --"52"Marvelous," said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in
turn. "Absolutely spiffing."
Percy scowled."That's enough, now," said Mrs. Weasley."Mum!" said Fred as though he'd only just spotted her and seizing her
hand too. "How really corking to see you --"
"I said, that's enough," said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in
an empty chair. "Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you've heard our excitingnews?" She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy's chest."Second Head Boy in the family!" she said, swelling with pride.
"And last," Fred muttered under his breath.I don't doubt that," said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. "I notice
they haven't made you two prefects."
"What do we want to be prefects for?" said George, looking revolted at
the very idea. "It'd take all the fun out of life."
Ginny giggled."Yo u want to set a better example for your sister!" snapped Mrs.
Weasley.
"Ginny's got other brothers to set her an example, Mother," said Percy
loftily. "I'm going up to change for dinner..."
He disappeared and George heaved a sigh."We tried to shut him in a pyramid," he told Harry. "But Mum spotted
us."
Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put
three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, andHermione ate their way through five delicious courses.53"How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?" asked Fred as they
dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.
"The Ministry's providing a couple of cars," said Mr. Weasley.Everyone looked up at him."Why?" said Percy curiously."It's because of you, Perce," said George seriously. "And there'll be
little flags on the hoods, with HB on them"
"-- for Humongous Bighead," said Fred.Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding."Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?" Percy asked again, in a
dignified voice.
"Well, as we haven't got one anymore," said Mr. Weasley,"-- and as I work there, they're doing me a favor --"His voice was casual, but Harry couldn't help noticing that Mr.
Weasley's ears had gone red, just like Ron's did when he was underPressure.
"Good thing, too," said Mrs. Weasley briskly. "Do you realize how much
luggage you've all got between you? A nice sight you'd be on the MuggleUnderground.... You are all packed, aren't you?"
"Ron hasn't put all his new things in his trunk yet," said Percy, in a
long-suffering voice. "He's dumped them on my bed."
"You'd better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won't have much time
in the morning," Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled atPercy.
After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they made54their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next
day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed andlocked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, andwent to see what was going on.
The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting."It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing"I haven't touched it, all right?" Ron roared back."What's up?" said Harry."My Head Boy badge is gone," said Percy, rounding on Harry."So's Scabbers's rat tonic," said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk
to look. "I think I might've left it in the bar --"
"You're not going anywhere till you've found my badge!" yelled Percy."I'll get Scabbers's stuff, I'm packed," Harry said to Ron, and he went
downstairs.
Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark,
when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. Asecond later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs.
Weasleys'. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he'd heard them
arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closerto the parlor door.
"--makes no sense not to tell him," Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly.
"Harry's got a right to know. I've tried to tell Fudge, but he insistson treating Harry like a child. He's thirteen years old and --"
"Arthur, the truth would terrify him!" said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. "Do
you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him?For heaven's sake, he's happy not knowing!"
"I don't want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!"55retorted Mr. Weasley. "You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering
off by themselves -- they've ended up in the Forbidden Forest twice! ButHarry mustn't do that this year! When I think what could have happenedto him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn't pickedhim up, I'm prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministryfound him."
"But he's not dead, he's fine, so what's the point"Molly, they say Sirius Black's mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever
enough to escape from Azkaban, and that's supposed to be impossible.It's been three weeks, and no one's seen hide nor hair of him, and Idon't care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we're no nearercatching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing weknow for sure is what Black's after
"But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.""We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of
Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts."
"But no one's really sure that Black's after HarryThere was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his
fist on the table.
"Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn't report it in
the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out toAzkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Blacks beentalking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: 'He's atHogwarts... he's at Hogwarts.' Black is deranged, Molly, and he wantsHarry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bringYou-Know-Who back to pow er. Black lost everything the night Harrystopped You- Know-Who, and he's had twelve years alone in Azkaban tobrood on that...."
There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to
hear more.
"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you're56forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don't think anything could hurt Harry at
Hogwarts while Dumbledore's headmaster. I suppose he knows about allthis?"
"Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards
stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. Hewasn't happy about it, but he agreed."
"Not happy? Why shouldn't he be happy, if they're there to catch Black?""Dumbledore isn't fond of the Azkaban guards," said Mr. Weasley heavily.
"Nor am 1, if it comes to that... but when you're dealing with a wizardlike Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd ratheravoid."
"If they save Harry then I will never say another word against them,
said Mr. Weasley wearily. "It's late, Molly, we'd better go up...."
Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the
passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a fewseconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbingthe stairs.
The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at
earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's bedroom doorclose, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.
Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving
with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron's roomin search of his badge.
"We've got it," Fred whispered to Harry. "We've been improving it."The badge now read Bighead Boy.Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself
in his room and lay down on his bed.
So Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been
lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He'd made57Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards
to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take themall to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harryuntil he was on the train.
Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why
he didn't feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen peoplewith one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would bepanic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agreewholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth waswherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn't people always say thatDumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of?Surely Black, as Voldemort's right-hand man, would be just as frightenedof him?
And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about.
They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationedall around the school, Black's chances of getting inside seemed veryremote.
No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his
chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would wantHarry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact,Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until thedanger had passed.
He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn't look after
himself? He'd escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he wasn't completelyuseless....
Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent
crossed his mind. What to do when you know the worst is coming...
"I'm not going to be murdered," Harry said out loud."That's the spirit, dear," said his mirror sleepily.
CHAPTER 5
Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup
of tea. Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwigto get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pullinga sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.
"The sooner we get on the train, the better," he said. "At least I can
get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he's accusing me of dripping tea onhis photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know," Ron grimaced, "hisgirlfriend. She's hidden her face under the frame because her nose hasgone all blotchy..."
"I've got something to tell you," Harry began, but they were interrupted
by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriatingPercy again.
They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front
page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley wastelling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a younggirl. All three of them were rather giggly.
"What were you saying?" Ron asked Harry as they sat down."Later," Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving;
they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron'snarrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig andHermes, Percy's screech owl, perched on top in their cages. A smallwickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.
"It's all right, Crookshanks," Hermione cooed through the wickerwork.
"I'll let you out on the train."
"You won't," snapped Ron. "What about poor Scabbers, eh?"He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was
curled up in his pocket.
Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck59his head inside.
"They're here, he said. "Harry, come on."Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward
the first of two old- fashioned dark green cars, each of which wasdriven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.
"In you get, Harry," said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded
street.
Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione,
Ron, and, to Ron's disgust, Percy.
The journey to King's Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry's
trip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almostordinary. though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps thatUncle Vernon's new company car certainly couldn't have managed. Theyreached King's Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry driversfound them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in saluteto Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head ofan unmoving line at the traffic lights.
Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry's elbow all the way into the station."Right then," he said, glancing around them. "Let's do this in pairs, as
there are so many of us. I'll go through first with Harry."
Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten,
pushing Harry's trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look atHarry, he leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.
In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto
platform nine and three- quarters and looked up to see the HogwartsExpress, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packedwith witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and
had apparently taken the barrier at a run.60"Ah, there's Penelope!" said Percy, smoothing his hair and going Pink
again. Ginny caught Harry's eye, and they both turned away to hide theirlaughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walkingwith his chest thrown out so that she couldn't miss his shiny badge.stood back to let him on. They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr.and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them fromview.
"I need to talk to you in private," Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione
as the train picked up speed.
"Go away, Ginny," said Ron."Oh, that's nice," said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off.Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty
compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of thetrain.
This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the
window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. The HogwartsExpress was usually reserved for students and they had never seen anadult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart.
The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard's robes that
had been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Thoughquite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.
"Who d'you reckon he is?" Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door
shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.
"Professor R. J. Lupin," whispered Hermione at once."How d'you know that?""It's on his case," she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the
man's head, where there was a small, battered case held together with alarge quantity of neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupinwas stamped across one corner in peeling letters.61"Wonder what he teaches?" said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin's pallid
profile.
"That's obvious," whispered Hermione. "There's only one vacancy, isn't
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumorsthat the job was jinxed.
"well, I hope he's up to it," said Ron doubtfully. "He looks like on,
good hex would finish him off, doesn't he? Anyway..." He turned toHarry. "What were you going to tell us?"
Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's argument and the
warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. \When he'd finished, Ron lookedthunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finallylowered them to say, "Sirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh,Harry... you'll have to be really, really careful. don't go looking fortrouble, Harry --"
"I Don't go looking for trouble," said Harry, nettled. "Trouble usually
finds me."
"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants
to kill him?" said Ron shakily.
They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and
Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was.
"No one knows how he got out of Azkaban," said Ron uncomfortably. "No
one's ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too."
"But they'll catch him, won't they?" said Hermione earnestly. "I Mean,
they've got all the Muggles looking out for him too...." "What's thatnoise?" said Ron suddenly.
A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. The, looked
all around the compartment.62"It's coming from your trunk, Harry," said Ron, standing UP and reaching
into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the PocketSneakoscope out from between Harry's robes. It was spinning very fast inthe palm of Ron's hand and glowing brilliantly.
"Is that a Sneakoscope?" said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a
better look.
"Yeah... mind you, it's a very cheap one," Ron said. "It went haywire
just as I was tying it to Errol's leg to send it to Harry."
"Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?" said Hermione
shrewdly.
"No! Well... I wasn't supposed to be using Errol. You know he's not
really up to long journeys... but how else was I supposed to get Harry'spresent to him?"
"Stick it back in the trunk," Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled
piercingly, "or it'll wake him up."
He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a
particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks, which deadenedthe sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.
"We could get it checked in Hogsmeade," said Ron, sitting back down.
"They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instrumentsand stuff. Fred and George told me."
"Do you know much about Hogsmeade?" asked Hermione keenly. "I've read
it's the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain --"
"Yeah, I think it is," said Ron in an offhand sort of way."But that's not Why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honey
Dukes."
"What's that?" said Hermione.63"It's this sweetshop," said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face,
"where they've got everything... Pepper Imps -- they make you smoke atthe mouth -- and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse andclotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck inclass and just look like you're thinking what to write next --"
"But Hogsmeade's a very interesting place, isn't it?" Hermione pressed
on eagerly. "In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was theheadquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shadessupposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain --"
"-- and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off
the ground while you're sucking them," said Ron, who was plainly notlistening to a word Hermione was saying.
Hermione looked around at Harry."Won't it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?""'Spect it will," said Harry heavily. "You'll have to tell me when
You've found out."
"What d'you mean?" said Ron."I can't go. The Dursleys didn't sign my permission form, and Fudge
wouldn't either."
Ron looked horrified.""You're not allowed to come? But -- no way -- McGonagall or someone
will give you permission -- " musclely; Crabbe was taller, with apudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristlyhair and long, gorilla-ish arms.
"Well, look who it is," said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling
open the compartment door. "Potty and the Weasel."
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly."I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer,64Weasley," said Malfoy. "Did your mother die of shock?"
Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks's basket to the floor.
Professor Lupin gave a snort.
"Who's that?" said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he
spotted Lupin.
"New teacher," said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed
to hold Ron back. "What were you saying, Malfoy?"
Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed; he wasn't fool enough to pick a fight right
under a teacher's nose.
"C'mon," he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they
disappeared.
Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles."I'm not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year," he said angrily.
"I mean it. If he makes one more crack about my family, I'm going to gethold of his head and --"
Ron made a violent gesture in midair."Ron," hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, "be careful..."But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were
now a solid, shimmering gray, which graduily darkened until lanternsflickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks.The train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still,Professor Lupin slept.
"We must be nearly there," said Ron, leaning forward to look past
Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.
The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down.65"Great," said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin
to try and see outside. "I'm starving. I want to get to the feast....
"We can't be there yet," said Hermione, checking her watch."So why're we stopping?"The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons
fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against thewindows.
Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All
along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of theircompartments.
The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told
them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning,all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.
"'What's going on?" said Ron's voice from behind Harry."Ouch!" gasped Hermione. "Ron, that was my foot!"Harry felt his way back to his seat."D'you think we've broken down?""Dunno..."There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron,
wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.
"There's something moving out there," Ron said. "I think people are
coming aboard...."
The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over
Harry's legs.
"Sorry -- d'you know what's going on? -- Ouch -- sorry66"Hullo, Neville," said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling
Neville up by his cloak.
"Harry? Is that you? What's happening?""No idea -- sit down --"There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on
Crookshanks.
"I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on," came Hermione's
voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, andthen a thud and two loud squeals of pain.
"Who's that?""Who's that?""Ginny?""Hermione?""What are you doing?""I was looking for Ron --" "Come in and sit down --""Not here!" said Harry hurriedly. "I'm here!""Ouch!" said Neville."Quiet!" said a hoarse voice suddenly.Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear
movements in his corner.
None of them spoke.There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the
compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames.They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and67wary.
"Stay where you are," he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got
slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.
But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's
hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face wascompletely hidden beneath its hood. Harry's eyes darted downward, andwhat he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding fromthe cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed,like something dead that had decayed in water...
But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature
beneath the cloak sensed Harry's gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawninto the folds of its black cloak.
And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow,
rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more thanair from its surroundings.
An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in
his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest,it was inside his very heart....
Harry's eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn't see. He was drowning
in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He wasbeing dragged downward, the roaring growing louder. .
And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified,
pleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move hisarms, but couldn't... a thick white fog was swirling around him, insidehim -
"Harry! Harry! Are you all right?"Someone was slapping his face."W -- what?"68Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was
shaking -- the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had comeback on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron andHermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see Nevilleand Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up hishand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.
Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat."Are you okay?" Ron asked nervously."Yeah," said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature
had vanished. "What happened? Where's that -- that thing? Who screamed?"
"No one screamed," said Ron, more nervously still.Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked
back at him, both very pale.
"But I heard screaming --"A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous
slab of chocolate into pieces.
"Here," he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. "Eat
it. It'll help."
Harry took the chocolate but didn't eat it."What was that thing?" he asked Lupin."A dementor," said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else.
"One of the dementors of Azkaban."
Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate
wrapper and put it in his pocket.
"Eat," he repeated. "It'll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse
me...69He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.
"Are you sure you're okay, Harry?" said Hermione, watching Harry
anxiously.
"I Don't get it.... What happened?" said Harry, wiping more sweat off
his face.
"Well -- that thing -- the dementor -- stood there and looked around (I
mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face) -- and you -- you
"I thought you were having a fit or something," said Ron, who still
looked scared. "You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat andstarted twitching -- 11
"And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor,
and pulled out his wand," said Hermione, "and he said, 'None of us ishiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.' But the dementor didn't move,so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand atit, and it turned around and sort of glided away.... "
"It was horrible," said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. "Did YOU
feel how cold it got when it came in?"
I felt weird," said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. "Like I'd
never be cheerful again...."
Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry
felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a comforting armaround her.
"But didn't any of you -- fall off your seats?" said Harry awkwardly."No," said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. "Ginny was shaking
like mad, though...."
Harry didn't understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he were
recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame.Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?70Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around,
and said, with a small smile, "I haven't poisoned that chocolate, youknow...."
Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly
to the tips of his fingers and toes.
"We'll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes," said Professor Lupin. "Are you
all right, Harry?"
Harry didn't ask how Professor Lupin knew his name."Fine," he muttered, embarrassed.They didn't talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last,
the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scrambleto get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville's pet toad croakedloudly from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rainwas driving down in icy sheets.
"Firs' years this way!" called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other endof the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forwardfor their traditional journey across the lake.
"All right, you three?" Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They
waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass ofpeople around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry,Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform andout onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoachesawaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, byan invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door,the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.
The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the
chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at himsideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.
As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron71gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars,
Harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either
side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leanedback into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed thegates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to thecastle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the manyturrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt,and Hermione and Ron got out.
As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear."You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottorn telling the truth? You actualy
fainted?"
Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry's way up the stone steps to
the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously."Shove off, Malfoy," said Ron, whose jaw was clenched.
"Did you faint as well, Weasley?" said Malfoy loudly. "Did the scary old
dementor frighten you too, Weasley?"
"Is there a problem?" said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten
out of the next carriage.
Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches
on his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasmin his voice, he said, "Oh, no -- er -- Professor," then he smirked atCrabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle.
Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of
them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak frontdoors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flamingtorches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upperfloors.
The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the
crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, whichwas black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, "Potter! Granger! Iwant to see you both!"72Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor McGonagall,
Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling overthe heads of the crowd. She was a sternlooking witch who wore her hairin a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harryfought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding: ProfessorMcGonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done somethingwrong.
"There's no need to look so worried -- I just want a word in MY office,"
she told them. "Move along there, Weasley."
Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from
the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, upthe marble staircase, and along a corridor.
Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire,
Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down. Shesettled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, "Professor Lupin sentan owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter."
Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam
Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in.
Harry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad enough that he'd
passed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone making all thisfuss.
"I'm fine," he said, "I don't need anything"Oh, it's you, is it?" said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending
down to stare closely at him. "I suppose you've been doing somethingdangerous again?"
"It was a dementor, Poppy," said Professor McGonagall.They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked disapprovingly."Setting dementors around a school, she muttered, pushing back Harry's
hair and feeling his forehead. "He won't be the last one who collapses.73Yes, he's all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they
have on people who are already delicate
"I'm not delicate!" said Harry crossly."Of course you're not," said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, now taking
his pulse.
"What does he need?" said Professor McGonagall crisply. "Bed rest?
Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?"
"I'm fine!" said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco Malfoy
would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture.
"Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least," said Madam
Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry's eyes.
"I've already had some," said Harry. "Professor Lupin gave me some. He
gave it to all of us."
"Did he, now?" said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. "So we've finally got a
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?"
"Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?" Professor McGonagall said
sharply.
"Yes, "said Harry."Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss
Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feasttogether."
Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the
hospital wing, muttering to herself He had to wait only a few minutes;then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed byProfessor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down themarble staircase to the Great Hall.
It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was
lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of74candles, which were floating over the tables in midair. Professor
Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, wascarrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out of the hall.
"Oh," said Hermione softly, "we've missed the Sorting!"New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the
sorting Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to(Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagallstrode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry andHermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, towardthe Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as they passed alongthe back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the storyof his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast?
He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them
seats.
"What was all that about?" he muttered to Harry.Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster
stood up to speak, and he broke off.
Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of
great energy. He had several feet of long silver hair and beard,half-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He was oftendescribed as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn't why Harryrespected him. You couldn't help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as Harrywatched him beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for thefirst time since the dementor had entered the train compartment.
"Welcome!" said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard.
"Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to youall, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it outof the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast...."
Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, "As you will all be aware
after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presentlyplaying host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here onMinistry of Magic business."75He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said about
Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school.
"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds," Dumbledore
continued, "and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobodyis to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled bytricks or disguises -- or even Invisibility Cloaks," he added blandly,and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. "It is not in the nature of adementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each andevery one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to theprefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no studentruns afoul of the dementors," he said.
Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest
again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he lookedvery seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.
"On a happier note," he continued, I am pleased to welcome two new
teachers to our ranks this year.
"First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who
had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clappedhard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby nextto all the other teachers in their best robes.
"Look at Snape!" Ron hissed in Harry's ear.Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table
at Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape ,anted theDefense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, wasstartled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. it was beyondanger: it was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it wasthe look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.
"As to our second new appointment," Dumbledore continued as the lukewarm
applause for Professor Lupin died away. "Well, I am sorry to tell you76that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher,
retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with hisremaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will befilled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on thisteaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned. Then they
joined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindortable in particular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who wasruby-red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his widegrin hidden in the tangle of his black beard.
"We should've known!" Ron roared, pounding the table. "Who else would
have assigned us a biting book?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as
Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid waswiping his eyes on the tablecloth.
"Well, I think that's everything of importance," said Dumbledore. "Let
the feast begin!"
The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and
drink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he couldreach and began to eat.
It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the
clatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, wereeager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew howmuch being made a teacher would mean to him. Hagrid wasn't a fullyqualified wizard; he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third yearfor a crime he had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and Hermionewho had cleared Hagrid's name last year.
At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the
golden platters, Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them allto go to bed, and they got their chance.
"Congratulations, Hagrid!" Hermione squealed as they reached the
teachers' table.77"All down ter you three," said Hagrid, wiping his shining face on his
napkin as he looked up at them., "Can' believe it... great man,Dumbledore... came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburnsaid he'd had enough.... It's what I always wanted. --"
Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and Professor
McGonagall shooed them away.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble
staircase and, very tired now, along more corridors, UP more and morestairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower's large portrait of afat lady in a pink dress asked them, "Password?"
"Coming through, coming through!" Percy called from behind the crowd.
"The new password's 'Fortuna Major'!"
"Oh no," said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble
remembering the passwords.
Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys
divided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stairwith no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back. Theyreached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-posterbeds, and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last.
CHAPTER 6
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the
next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to beentertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. Asthey passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit andthere was a roar of laughter.
"Ignore him," said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. "Just ignore
him, it's not worth it...."
"Hey, Potter!" shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face78like a pug. "Potter! The dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooooo!"
Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to George
Weasley.
"New third-year course schedules," said George, passing then, over.
"What's up with you, Harry?"
"Malfoy," said Ron, sitting down on George's other side and glaring over
at the Slytherin table.
George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror
again.
"That little git," he said calmly. "He wasn't so cocky last night when
the dementors were down at our end of the train. Came runing into ourcompartment, didn't he, Fred?"
"Nearly wet himself," said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy."I wasn't too happy myself," said George. "They're horrible things,
those dementors...."
"Sort of freeze your insides, don't they?" said Fred."You didn't pass out, though, did you?" said Harry in a low voice."Forget it, Harry," said George bracingly. "Dad had to go out to Azkaban
one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he'd everbeen, he came back all weak and shaking.... They suck the happiness outof a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there."
"Anyway, we'll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch
match," said Fred. "Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of theseason, remember?"
The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch
match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly morecheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.79Hermione was examining her new schedule.
" Ooh, good, we're starting some new subjects today," she said happily.
villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come I. scornat my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!"
They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out
of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and downin rage. But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swingmade him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass.
"Are you all right?" said Harry, moving closer to the picture."Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!"The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up,
but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with allhis might, he couldn't get it out again. Finally, he had to flop backdown onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.
"Listen," said Harry, taking advantage of the knight's exhaustion,
"we're looking for the North Tower. You don't know the way, do you?"
"A quest!" The knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to
his feet and shouted, "Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall findour goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!"
He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the
fat pony, gave up, and cried, "On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady!On! On!"
And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of
sight.
They hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his
armor. Every now and then they spotted him running through a pictureahead.
"Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!" yelled the knight, and
they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in80crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.
Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling
steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmurof voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom.
"Farewell!" cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of some
sinister-looking monks. "Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you haveneed of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!"
"Yeah, we'll call you," muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, "if we
ever need someone mental."
They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where
most of the class was already assembled. There were no doors off thislanding, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where therewas a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.
"'Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,"' Harry read. "How're we
supposed to get up there?"
As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a
silvery ladder descended right at Harry's feet. Everyone got quiet.
"After you," said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. In
fact, it didn't look like a classroom at all, more like a cross betweensomeone's attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At leasttwenty small,circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintzarmchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimsonlight; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lampswere draped with dark red scarves. it was stiflingly warm, and the firethat was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy,sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelvesrunning around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-lookingfeathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards,countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.
Ron appeared at Harry's shoulder as the class assembled around them, all81talking in whispers.
"Where is she?" Ron said.A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice."Welcome," it said. "How nice to see you in the physical world at last."Harry's immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect.
Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she wasvery thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times theirnatural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerablechains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and handswere encrusted with bangles and rings.
"Sit, my children, sit," she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into
armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselvesaround the same round table.
"Welcome to Divination," said Professor Trelawney, who had seated
herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. "My name is professorTrelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending toooften into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my InnerEye."
Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor
Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, "So you havechosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. Imust warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there isvery little I will be able to teach you.. Books can take you only so farin this field...."
At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who
looked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in thissubject.
"Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud
bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetratethe veiled mysteries of the future," Professor Trelawney went on, herenormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. "It is a Gift82granted to few. You, boy," she said suddenly to Neville, who almost
toppled off his pouf. "Is your grandmother well?"
"I think so," said Neville tremulously."I wouldn't be so sure if I were you, dear," said Professor Trelawney,
the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped.Professor Trelawney continued placidly. "We will be covering the basicmethods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted toreading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By theway, my dear," she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, "beware a red-hairedman."
Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged
her chair away from him.
"In the second term," Professor Trelawney went on, "we shall progress to
the crystal ball -- if we have finished with fire omens, that is.Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout offlu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our numberwill leave us forever."
A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor
Trelawney seemed unaware of it.
"I wonder, dear," she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank
back in her chair, "if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?"
Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the
shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.
"Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading -- it
will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October."
Lavender trembled."Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the
shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drinkuntil only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times withthe left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the83last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to
read. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six ofUnfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing.Oh, and dear" -- she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up --"after you've broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to selectone of the blue patterned ones? I'm rather attached to the pink."
Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when
there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over tohim holding a dustpan and brush and said, "One of the blue ones, then,dear, if you wouldn't mind... thank you. ... "
When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their
table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled thedregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained thecups and swapped over.
"Right," said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six.
"What can you see in mine?"
"A load of soggy brown stuff," said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke in
the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid.
"Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the
mundane!" Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom.
Harry tried to pull himself together."Right, you've got a crooked sort of cross... " He consulted Unfogging
the Future. "That means you're going to have 'trials and suffering' --sorry about that -- but there's a thing that could be the sun... hangon... that means 'great happiness'... so you're going to suffer but bevery happy...."
"You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me," said Ron, and they both
had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in theirdirection.
"My turn..." Ron peered into Harry's teacup, his forehead wrinkled with
effort. "There's a blob a bit like a bowler hat," he said. "Maybe you're84going to work for the Ministry of Magic...
He turned the teacup the other way up."But this way it looks more like an acorn.... What's that?" He scanned
his copy of Unfogging the Future. "'A windfall, unexpected gold.'Excellent, you can lend me some... and there's a thin, here," he turnedthe cup again, "that looks like an animal... yeah, if that was itshead... it looks like a hippo... no, a sheep..."
Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter."Let me see that, my dear," she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over
and snatching Harry's cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch.
Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it
counterclockwise.
"The falcon... my dear, you have a deadly enemy.""But everyone knows that, " said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor
Trelawney stared at her.
"Well, they do," said Hermione. "Everybody knows about Harry and
You-Know-Who."
Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration.
They had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before.Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered her huge eyes toHarry's cup again and continued to turn it.
"The club... an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup....I thought that was a bowler hat," said Ron sheepishly."The skull... danger in your path, my dear...."Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the
cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed.85There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his
second cup. Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, herglittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed.
"My dear boy... my poor, dear boy no it is kinder not to say.. . no...
don't ask me...."
"What is it, Professor?" said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to
their feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron's table,pressing close to Professor Trelawney's chair to get a
good look at Harry's cup."My dear," Professor Trelawney's huge eyes opened dramatically,"You have the Grim.""The what?" said Harry.He could tell that he wasn't the only one who didn't understand; Dean
Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearlyeverybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.
"The Grim, my dear, the Grim!" cried Professor Trelawney, who looked
shocked that Harry hadn't understood. "The giant, spectral dog thathaunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen -- the worst omen -- ofdeath!"
Harry's stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in
Flourish and Blotts -the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent...Lavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was lookingat Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved aroundto the back of Professor Trelawney's chair.
"I don't think it looks like a Grim," she said flatly.Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike."You'll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little
aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the86future." Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side.
"It looks like a Grim if you do this," he said, with his eyes almost
shut, "but it looks more like a donkey from here," he said, leaning tothe left.
"When you've all finished deciding whether I'm going to die Or not!"
said Harry, taking even himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to wantto look at him.
"I think we will leave the lesson here for today," said Professor
Trelawney in her mistiest voice. "Yes... please pack away yourthings...."
Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney,
packed away their books, and closed their bags. Even Ron was avoidingHarry's eyes.
"Until we meet again," said Professor Trelawney faintly, "fair fortune
be yours. Oh, and dear" -- she pointed at Neville -- "you'll be latenext time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney's ladder and the
winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall'sTransfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her classroom that,early as they had left Divination, they were only just in time.
Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he
were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class keptshooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead atany moment. He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling themabout Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), andwasn't even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyesinto a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes.
"Really, what has got into you all today?" said Professor McGonagall,
turning back into herself with a faint pop, and staring around at themall. "Not that it matters, but that's the first time my transformation'snot got applause from a class."87Everybody's heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then
Hermione raised her hand.
"Please, Professor, we've just had our first Divination class, and we
were reading the tea leaves, and --"
"Ah, of course," said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning."There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you
will be dying this year?"
Everyone stared at her."Me," said Harry, finally."I see," said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes.
"Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted thedeath of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None ofthem has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting anew class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of mycolleagues --"
Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone
white. She went on, more calmly, "Divination is one of the mostimprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I havevery little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and ProfessorTrelawney --"
She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, "You
look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don'tlet you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need nothand it in."
Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared
of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddlingperfume of Professor Trelawney's classroom. Not everyone was convinced,however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, "But whatabout Neville's cup?"
When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd88thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.
"Ron, cheer up," said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him. "You
heard what Professor McGonagall said."
Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn't start."Harry," he said, in a low, serious voice, "You haven't seen a great
black dog anywhere, have you?"
"Yeah, I have," said Harry. "I saw one the night I left the Dursleys'. "Ron let his fork fall with a clatter."Probably a stray," said Hermione calmly.Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad."Hermione, if Harry's seen a Grim, that's -- that's bad," he said. "My
-- my uncle Bilius saw one and -- and he died twenty-four hours later!"
"Coincidence," said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice."You don't know what you're talking about!" said Ron, starting to get
angry. "Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!"
"There you are, then," said Hermione in a superior tone. "They see the
Grim and die of fright. The Grim's not an omen, it's the cause of death!And Harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one andthink, right, well, I'd better kick the bucket then!"
Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new
Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug.
"I think Divination seems very woolly," she said, searching for her
page. "A lot of guesswork, if you ask me."
"There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!" said Ron hotly."You didn't seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a89sheep," said Hermione coolly.
"Professor Trelawney said you didn't have the right aura! You just don't
like being bad at something for a change!"
He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the
table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.
"If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens
in a lump of tea leaves, I'm not sure I'll be studying it much longer!That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!"
She snatched up her bag and stalked away.Ron frowned after her."What's she talking about?" he said to Harry. "She hasn't been to an
Arithmancy class yet."
Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday's rain
had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was springyand damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care of MagicalCreatures class.
Ron and Hermione weren't speaking to each other. Harry walked beside
them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid's hut onthe edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted threeonly-too- familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must behaving these lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedlyto Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure he knewwhat they were talking about.
Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood in his
moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his heels, lookingimpatient to start.
"C'mon, now, get a move on!" he called as the class approached. "Got a
real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin' up! Everyone here? Right,follow me!"90For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them
into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there tolast him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of thetrees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind ofpaddock. There was nothing in there.
"Everyone gather 'round the fence here!" he called. "That's it -- make
sure yeh can see -- now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yerbooks --"
"How?" said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy."Eh?" said Hagrid."How do we open our books?" Malfoy repeated. He took out his copy of The
Monster Book of Monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of rope.Other people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had belted theirbook shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped themtogether with binder clips.
"Hasn' -- hasn' anyone bin able ter open their books?" said Hagrid,
looking crestfallen.
The class all shook their heads."Yeh've got ter stroke 'em," said Hagrid, as though this was the most
obvious thing in the world. "Look --"
He took Hermione's copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The
book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine,and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.
"Oh, how silly we've all been!" Malfoy sneered. "We should have stroked
them! why didn't we guess!"
"I -- I thought they were funny," Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione."Oh, tremendously funny!" said Malfoy. "Really witty, giving us books
that try and rip our hands off!"91"Shut up, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking downcast and
Harry wanted Hagrid's first lesson to be a success.
"Righ' then," said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, "so -- so
yeh've got yer books an' -- an' - - now yeh need the Magical Creatures.Yeah. So I'll go an' get 'em. Hang on... "
He strode away from them into the forest and out of sight."God, this place is going to the dogs," said Malfoy loudly. "That oaf
teaching classes, my father'll have a fit when I tell him
"Shut up, Malfoy," Harry repeated."Careful, Potter, there's a dementor behind you"Oooooooh!" squealed Lavender Brown, pointing toward the opposite side
of the paddock.
Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry
had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, butthe front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, withcruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly, orange eyes. Thetalons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking.Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which wasattached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in thevast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind thecreatures.
"Gee up, there!" he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures
toward the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly asHagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence.
"Hippogriffs!" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. "Beau'iful,
aren' they?"
Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first
shock of seeing something that was, half horse, half bird, you startedto appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly fromfeather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze,92pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black.
"So," said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, "if
yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer --"
No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached
the fence cautiously.
"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,"
said Hagrid. "Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one,'cause it might be the last thing yeh do."
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; they were talking in an
undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best todisrupt the lesson.
"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move," Hagrid
continued. "It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an' yehwait. If he bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. If he doesn' bow,then get away from him sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt.
"Right -- who wants ter go first?"Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and
Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce headsand flexing their powerful wings; they didn't seem to like beingtethered like this.
"No one?" said Hagrid, with a pleading look."I'll do it," said Harry.There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and
Parvati whispered, "Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!"
Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence."Good man, Harry!" roared Hagrid. "Right then -- let's see how yeh get
on with Buckbeak."93He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its
fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other sideof the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes werenarrowed maliciously.
"Easy) now, Harry," said Hagrid quietly. "Yeh've got eye contact, now
try not ter blink.... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink toomuch...."
Harry's eyes immediately began to water, but he didn't shut thern.
Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at Harry withone fierce orange eye. "Tha's it," said Hagrid. "Tha's it, Harry... now,bow."
Harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak,
but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up.
The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn't move."Ah," said Hagrid, sounding worried. "Right -- back away, now, Harry,
easy does it
But then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its
scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.
"Well done, Harry!" said Hagrid, ecstatic. "Right -- yeh can touch him!
Pat his beak, go on!"
Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved
slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted thebeak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as thoughenjoying it.
The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,
who were looking deeply disappointed.
"Righ' then, Harry," said Hagrid. "I reckon he might' let yeh ride him!"This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick;
but he wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.94"Yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint," said Hagrid, "an' mind
yeh don' pull any of his feathers out, he won' like that...."
Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto
its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn't sure where to hold on;everything in front of him was covered with feathers.
"Go on, then'" roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters.Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry,
he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he wassoaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew whichone he preferred; the hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on eitherside of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he wasabout to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingersand he didn't dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action ofhis Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward andforward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with itswings.
Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the
ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as thesmooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak,then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. Hejust managed to hold on and push himself straight again.
"Good work, Harry!" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and
Goyle cheered. "Okay, who else wants a go?"
Emboldened by Harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously
into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soonpeople were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ranrepeatedly backward from his, which didn't seem to want to bend itsknees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to
Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful.
"This is very easy," Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him.95"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it.... I bet you're not
dangerous at all, are you?" he said to the hippogriff. "Are you, yougreat ugly brute?"
It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a highpitched
scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into hiscollar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass,blood blossoming over his robes.
"I'm dying!" Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. "I'm dying, look at
me! It's killed me!"
"Yer not dyin'!" said Hagrid, who had gone very white. "Someone help me
-- gotta get him outta here --"
Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As
they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy's arm;blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope towardthe castle.
Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The
Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid.
"They should fire him straight away!" said Pansy Parkinson, who was in
tears.
"It was Malfoy's fault!" snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed
their muscles threateningly.
They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall."I'm going to see if he's okay!" said Pansy, and they all watched her
run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering aboutHagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room;Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.
"You think he'll be all right?" said Hermione nervously."Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second," said
Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse.96"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though,
wasn't it?" said Ron, looking worried. "Trust Malfoy to mess things upfor him...."
They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping
to see Hagrid, but he wasn't there.
"They wouldn't fire him, would they?" said Hermione anxiously, not
touching her steak-and- kidney pudding.
"They'd better not," said Ron, who wasn't eating either.Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe
and Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was surethey were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured.
"Well, you can't say it wasn't an interesting first day back," said Ron
gloomily.
They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and
tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but allthree of them kept breaking off and glancing Out of the tower window.
"There's a light on in Hagrid's window," Harry said suddenly.Ron looked at his watch."If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It's still quite early..."I don't know," Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him."I'm allowed to walk across the grounds, " he said Pointedly. "Sirius
Black hasn't got past the dementors yet, has he?"
So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad
to meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren't entirelysure they were supposed to be out.
The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. When97they reached Hagrid's hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, "C'min."
Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his
boarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid's lap. One look told them thatHagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as bigas a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficultygetting them into focus.
"'Spect it's a record," he said thickly, when he recognized them. "Don'
reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before."
"You haven't been fired, Hagrid!" gasped Hermione."Not yet," said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in
the tankard. "But's only a matter o' time, i' n't it, after Malfoy..."
"How is he?" said Ron as they all sat down. "It wasn't serious, was it?""Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could," said Hagrid dully, "but he's
sayin' it's still agony... covered in bandages... moanin'..
"He's faking it, " said Harry at once. "Madam Pomfrey can mend anything.
She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it'sworth."
"School gov'nors have bin told, o' course," said Hagrid miseribly. "They
reckon I started too big. Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later... doneflobberworms or summat.... Jus' thought itdmake a good firs' lessons allmy fault...."
"It's all Malfoy's fault, Hagrid!" said Hermione earnestly."We're witnesses," said Harry. "You said hippogriffs attack if you
insult them. It's Malfoy's problem that he wasn't listening. We'll tellDumbledore what really happened."
"Yeah, don't worry, Hagrid, we'll back you up," said Ron.Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid's beetle-black eyes.
He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.98"I think you've had enough to drink, Hagrid," said Hermione firmly. She
took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.
"At, maybe she's right," said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who
both staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out ofhis chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loudsplash.
"What's he done?" said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with the
empty tankard.
"Stuck his head in the water barrel," said Hermione, putting the tankard
away.
Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water
out of his eyes.
"That's better," he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them
all. "Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an' see me, I really --
Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he'd only just realized
he was there.
"WHAT D'YEH THINK YOU'RE DOIN', EH?" he roared, so suddenly that they
jumped a foot in the air. "YEH'RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN' AROUND AFTERDARK,HARRY! AN, YOU TWO! LETTIN' HIM!"
Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the
door.
"C'mon!" Hagrid said angrily. "I'm takin' yer all back up ter school,
an' don' let me catch yeh walkin' down ter see me after dark again. I'mnot worth that!"
CHAPTER 7
Malfoy didn't reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when
the Slytherins and Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. Heswaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and boundup in a sling, acting, in Harry's opinion, as though he were the heroicsurvivor of some dreadful battle.
"How is it, Draco?" simpered Pansy Parkinson. "Does it hurt much?""Yeah," said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw
him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.
"Settle down, settle down," said Professor Snape idly.Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn't have said "settle
down" if they'd walked in late, he'd have given them detention. ButMalfoy had always been able to get away with anything in Snape'sclasses; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generality favored hisown students above all others.
They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up
his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparingtheir ingredients on the same table.
"Sir," Malfoy called, "sir, I'll need help cutting up these daisy roots,
because of my arm --"
"Weasley, cut up Malfoy's roots for him," said Snape without looking up.Ron went brick red."There's nothing wrong with your arm," he hissed at Malfoy.Malfoy smirked across the table."Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots."Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy's roots toward him, and began to
chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.
"Professor," drawled Malfoy, "Weasley's mutilating my roots, sit."100Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots,
then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy blackhair.
"Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.""But, sit --!"Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own
roots into exactly equal pieces.
"Now," said Snape in his most dangerous voice.Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table a, Malfoy,
then took up the knife again.
"And, sir, I'll need this shrivelfig skinned," said Malfoy, his voice
full of malicious laughter.
"Potter, you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig," said Snape, giving Harry the
look of loathing he always reserved just for him.
Harry took Malfoy's shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage
to the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast ashe could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking.Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.
"Seen your pal Hagrid lately?" he asked them quietly."None of your business," said Ron jerkily, without looking up."I'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer," said Malfoy in a tone of
mock sorrow. "Father's not very happy about my injury --"
"Keep talking, Malfoy, and I'll give you a real injury," snarled Ron."- he's complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of
Magic. Father's got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injurylike this" -- he gave a huge, fake sigh -- "who knows if my arm'll ever101be the same again?"
"So that's why you're putting it on," said Harry, accidentally beheading
a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger. "To try to getHagrid fired."
"Well," said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, "partly, Potter.
But there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars forme."
A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to
pieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst subject, and his great fearof Professor Snape made things ten times worse. His potion, which wassupposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned --
"Orange, Longbottom," said Snape, ladling some up and allowing to splash
back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see.
"Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of
yours? Didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one -tat spleenwas needed? Didn't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice wouldsuffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?"
Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge
of tears.
"Please, sir," said Hermione, "please, I could help Neville put it right
--"
"I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger," said Snape
coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. "Longbottom, at the end ofthis lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and seewhat happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly."
Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear."Help me!" he moaned to Hermione."Hey, Harry," said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry's brass
scales, "have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning -- they reckon102Sirius Black's been sighted."
"Where?" said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other side of the table,
Malfoy looked up, listening closely.
"Not too far from here," said Seamus, who looked excited. "It was a
Muggle who saw him. 'Course, she didn't really understand. The Mugglesthink he's just an ordinary criminal, don't they? So she phoned thetelephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he wasgone."
"Not too far from here... " Ron repeated, looking significantly at
Harry. He turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely. "What, Malfoy?Need something else skinned?"
But Malfoy's eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed Harry.
He leaned across the table.
Black single-handed, Potter?""Thinking Of trying to catch"Yeah, that's right," said Harry offhandedly.Malfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smile."Of course, if it was me," he said quietly, "I'd have done something
before now. I wouldn't be staying in school like a good boy, I'd be outthere looking for him."
"What are you talking about, Malfoy?" said Ron roughly."Don't you know, Potter?" breathed Malfoy, his pate eyes narrowed."Know what?"Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh."Maybe you'd rather not risk your neck," he said. "Want to leave it to
the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I'd want revenge. I'd hunt him103down myself."
"What are you talking about?" said Harry angrily, but at that moment
Snape called, "You should have finished adding your ingredients by now;this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away while itsimmers and then we'll test Longbottom's... "
Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred
his potion feverishly. Hermione was muttering instructions to him out ofthe corner of her mouth, so that Snape wouldn't see. Harry and Ronpacked away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands andladles in the stone basin in the corner.
"What did Malfoy mean?" Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands
under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle's mouth "Why would Iwant revenge on Black? He hasn't done anything to me -- yet.
"He's making it up," said Ron savagely. "He's trying to make you do
something stupid...."
The end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who was
cowering by his cauldron.
"Everyone gather 'round," said Snape, his black eyes glittering, and
watch what happens to Longbottom's toad. If he has managed to produce aShrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don't doubt,he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned."
The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excited. Snape
picked up Trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon intoNeville's potion, which was now green. He trickled a few drops downTrevor's throat.
There was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; then there
was a small pop, and Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape's palm.
The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small
bottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor,and he reappeared suddenly, fully grown.104"Five points from Gryffindor," said Snape, which wiped the smiles from
every face. "I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall. Harry
was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seethingabout Snape.
"Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right!Why didn't You lie, Hermione? You should've said Neville did it all by
himself!"
Hermione didn't answer. Ron looked around."Where is she?"Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the
rest of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch.
"She was right behind us," said Ron, frowning.Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He smirked at
Harry and disappeared.
"There she is," said Harry.Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched
her bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of herrobes.
"How did you do that?" said Ron."What?" said Hermione, joining them."One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at
the bottom of the stairs again."
"What?" Hermione looked slightly confused. "Oh -- I had to go back for
something. Oh no --"105A seam had split on Hermione's bag. Harry wasn't surprised; he could see
that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.
"Why are you carrying all these around with you?" Ron asked her."You know how many subjects I'm taking," said Hermione breathlessly.
"Couldn't hold these for me, could you?"
"But --" Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at
the covers. "You havent got any of these subjects today. It's onlyDefense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon."
"Oh yes," said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into
her bag just the same. I hope there's something good for lunch, I'mstarving," she added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.
"D'you get the feeling Hermione's not telling us something?Ron asked
Harry.
Professor Lupin wasn't there when they arrived at his first Defense
Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books,quills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally entered theroom. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on theteacher's desk. He was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than hehad on the train, as though he had had a few square meals.
"Good afternoon," he said. "Would you please put all your books back in
your bags. Today's will be a practical lesson. You will need only yourwands."
A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books.
They had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark Arts before,unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacherhad brought a cageful of pixies -to class and set them loose.
"Right then," said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. "If you'd
follow me."
Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor
Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted corridor and106around a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the
Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing thenearest keyhole with chewing gum.
Peeves didn't look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; ,hen he
wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song.
"Loony, loopy Lupin," Peeves sang. "Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, loopy
Lupin --"
Rude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually showed
some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at ProfessorLupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he was stillsmiling.
"I'd take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves," he said
pleasantly. "Mr. Filch won't be able to get in to his brooms."
Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who
waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However,Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin's words, except to blow aloud wet raspberry.
Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand."This is a useful little spell, he told the class over his shoulder.
"Please watch closely."
He raised the wand to shoulder height, said, "Waddiwasi! "and pointed it
at Peeves.
With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the
keyhole and straight down Peeves's left nostril; he whirled upright andzoomed away, cursing.
"Cool, sit!" said Dean Thomas in amazement."Thank you, Dean," said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again.
"Shall we proceed?"107They set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with
increased respect. He led them down a second corridor and stopped, rightoutside the staffroom door.
"Inside, please," said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back.The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was
empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sitting in a lowarmchair, and he looked around as the class filed in. His eyes wereglittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth. AsProfessor Lupin came in and made to close the door behind him, Snapesaid, "Leave it open, Lupin. I'd rather not witness this."
He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing
behind him. At the doorway he turned on his heel and said, "Possibly noone's warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. Iwould advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unlessMiss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear."
Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he
bullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of otherteachers.
Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows."I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the
operation," he said, "and I am sure he will perform it admirably."
Neville's face went, if possible, even redder. Snape's lip curled, but
he left, shutting the door with a snap.
"Now, then," said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of
the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teacherskept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, thewardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.
"Nothing to worry about," said Professor Lupin calmly because a few
people had jumped backward in alarm. "There's a boggart in there."
Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about.108Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan
eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.
"Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces," said Professor Lupin. "Wardrobes,
the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks -- I've even met onethat had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved inyesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leaveit to give my third years some practice.
"So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?"Hermione put up her hand."It's a shape-shifter," she said. "It can take the shape of whatever it
thinks will frighten us most."
"Couldn't have put it better myself," said Professor Lupin, and Hermione
glowed. "So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yetassumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person onthe other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like whenhe is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatevereach of us most fears.
"This means," said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville's 'mall
sputter of terror, "that we have a huge advantage over the boggartbefore we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?"
Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and
down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was veryoff-putting, but Harry had a go.
"Er -- because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape it
should be?"
"Precisely," said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down,
looking a little disappointed. "It's always best to have com pany whenyou're dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should hebecome, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggartmake that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once andturned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.109"The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of
mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter.What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.
"We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please ...
Riddikulus!"
"Riddikulus!" said the class together."Good," said Professor Lupin. "Very good. But that was the easy part,
I'm afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where youcome in, Neville."
The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked
forward as though he were heading for the gallows.
"Right, Neville," said Professor Lupin. "First things first: what would
you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?"
Neville's lips moved, but no noise came out."didn't catch that, Neville, sorry," said Professor Lupin cheerfully.Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help
him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, "Professor Snape."
Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor
Lupin, however, looked thoughtful.
"Professor Snape... hmmm... Neville, I believe you live with your
grandmother?"
"Er -- yes," said Neville nervously. "But -- I don't want the boggart to
turn into her either."
"No, no, you misunderstand me," said Professor Lupin, now smiling. "I
wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usuallywears?"110Neville looked startled, but said, "Well... always the same hat. A tall
one with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress... green,normally... and sometimes a fox-fur scarf."
"And a handbag?" prompted Professor Lupin."A big red one," said Neville."Right then," said Professor Lupin. "Can you picture those clothes very
clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind's eye?"
"Yes," said Neville uncertainty, plainly wondering what was coming next."When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees You, it
will assume the form of Professor Snape," said Lupin. "And You willraise your wand -- thus -- and cry 'Riddikulus' -- and concentrate hardon your grandmother's clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snapewill be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, withthat big red handbag."
There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more
violently.
"If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention
to each of us in turn," said Professor Lupin. "I would like all of youto take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, andimagine how you might force it to look comical...."
The room went quiet. Harry thought... 'What scared him most in the
world?
His first thought was Lord Voldemort -- a Voldemort returned to full
strength. But before he had even started to plan a possiblecounterattack on a boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came floating tothe surface of his mind....
A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak ... a
long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth... then a cold so penetratingit felt like drowning....111Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed. Many
people had their eyes shut tight. Ron was muttering to himself, "Takeits legs off " Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron'sgreatest fear was spiders.
"Everyone ready?" said Professor Lupin.Harry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn't ready. How could you make a
dementor less frightening? But he didn't want to ask for more time;everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves.
"Neville, we're going to back away," said Professor Lupin. "Let you have
a clear field, all right? I'll call the next person forward.... Everyoneback, now, so Neville can get a clear shot --"
They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone
beside the wardrobe. He looked pale and frightened, but he had pushed upthe sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready.
"On the count of three, Neville," said Professor Lupin, who waspointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe. "One two -- three
-- now!"
A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin's wand and hit the
doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, ProfessorSnape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.
Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing
down upon him, reaching inside his robes.
"R -- r -- riddikulus! "squeaked Neville.There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a
long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eatenvulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.
There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and
Professor Lupin shouted, "Parvati! Forward!"112Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was
another crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandagedmummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walktoward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising --
"Riddikulus!" cried Parvati.A bandage unraveled at the mummy's feet; it became entangled, fell face
forward, and its head rolled off.
"Seamus!" roared Professor Lupin.Seamus darted past Parvati.Crack! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair
and a skeletal, green-tinged face -- a banshee. She opened her mouthwide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek thatmade the hair on Harry's head stand on end -- 'Riddikulus!" shoutedSeamus.
The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was
gone.
Crack! The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle,
then -- crack!- became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before-- crack! -- becoming a single, bloody eyeball.
'It's confused!" shouted Lupin. "We're getting there! Dean!"Dean hurried forward.Crack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and began
to creep along the floor like a crab.
"Riddikulus!" yelled Dean.'There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap."Excellent! Ron, you next!"113Ron leapt forward.
Crack!Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered
in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For amoment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then --
"Riddikulus!" bellowed Ron, and the spider's legs vanished; it rolled
over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and itcame to a halt at Harry's feet. He raised his wand, ready, but --
"Here!" shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. Crack!The legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly
around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging inthe air in front of Lupin, who said, "Riddikulus!" almosi lazily.
Crack!"Forward, Neville, and finish him off!" said Lupin as the boggart landed
on the floor as a cockroach. Crack! Snape was back. This time Nevillecharged forward looking determined.
"Riddikulus!" he shouted, and they had a split second's view of Snape in
his lacy dress before Neville let out a great "Ha!" of laughter, and theboggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and wasgone.
"Excellent!" cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause.
"Excellent) Neville. Well done, everyone.... Let me See... five pointsto Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart -- ten for Nevillebecause he did it twice... and five each to Hermione and Harry."
"But I didn't do anything," said Harry."You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the
class, Harry," Lupin said lightly. "Very well, everyone, an excellentlesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize itfor me... to be handed in on Monday. That will be all."114Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn't
feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him fromtackling the boggart. Why? Was it because he'd seen Harry collapse onthe train, and thought he wasn't up to much? Had he thought Harry wouldpass out again?
But no one else seemed to have noticed anything."Did you see me take that banshee?" shouted Seamus. "And the hand!" said
Dean, waving his own around.
"And Snape in that hat!" "And my mummy!"I wonder why Professor Lupin's frightened of crystal balls?" said
Lavender thoughtfully.
"That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we've ever had,
wasn't it?" said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to theclassroom to get their bags.
"He seems like a very good teacher," said Hermione approvingly. "But I
wish I could have had a turn with the boggart --"
"What would it have been for you?" said Ron, sniggering. "A piece of
homework that only got nine out of ten?"
CHAPTER 8
In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most
people's favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherinshad anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.
"Look at the state of his robes," Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as
Professor Lupin passed. "He dresses like our old houseelf "
But no one else cared that Professor Lupin's robes were patched and
frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first.115After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblin like
creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeonsof castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting tobludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on tokappas, creepy. water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, withwebbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.
Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst
of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood thesedays, and no one was in any doubt why. The story of the boggart assumingSnape's shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in hisgrandmother's clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire.Snape didn't seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at thevery mention of Professor Lupin's name, and he was bullying Nevilleworse than ever.
Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor
Trelawney's stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes andsymbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney's enormous eyesfilled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn't likeProfesser Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect borderingon reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown hadtaken to haunting Professor Trelawney's tower room at lunch times, andalways returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as thoughthey knew things the others didn't. They had also started using hushedvoices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he were on his deathbed.
Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the
action-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed tohave lost his confidence. They were now spending lesson after lessonlearning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of themost boring creatures in existence.
"Why would anyone bother looking after them?" said Ron, after yet
another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms' throats.
At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy
him, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactoryclasses. The Quidditch season was approaching, and O1iver Wood, Captainof the Gryffindor team, called a meeting on Thursday evening to discuss116tactics for the new season.
There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it
was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball)through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each
end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to
repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying toattack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal
posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching
the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose captureended the game and earned the Seeker's team an extra one hundred andfifty points.
Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh and final
year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice a'she addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms onthe edge of the darkening Quidditch field.
"This is our last chance -- my last chance -- to win the Quidditch Cup,"
he told them, striding up and down in front of them. "I'll be leaving atthe end of this year. I'll never get another shot at it."
"Gryffindor hasn't won for seven years now. Okay, so we've had the worst
luck in the world -- injuries -- then the tournamentgetting called offlast year Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump tohis throat. "But we also know we've got thebest-ruddy-team-in-the-school," he said, punching a fist into his otherhand, the old manic glint back in his eye. "We've got three superbChasers."
Wood pointed at Alicia Spinner, Angelina Johnson, and Katie Bell."We've got two unbeatable Beaters.""Stop it, Oliver, you're embarrassing us," said Fred and George Weasley
together, pretending to blush.
"And we've got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!" Wood117rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. "And me," he
added as an afterthought.
"We think you're very good too, Oliver," said George."Spanking good Keeper," said Fred."The point is," Wood went on, resuming his pacing, "the Quidditch Cup
should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harryjoined the team, I've thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven'tgot it, and this year's the last chance we'll get to finally see ourname on the thing...."
Wood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George looked sympathetic."Oliver, this year's our year," said Fred."We'll do it, Oliver!" said Angelina."Definitely," said Harry.Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three
evenings a week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nightsdarker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry'swonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup.
Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training,
cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find theroom buzzing excitedly.
"What's happened?", he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two
of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts forAstronomy.
"First Hogsmeade weekend," said Ron, pointing at a notice that had
appeared on the battered old bulletin board. "End of October.Halloween."
"Excellent," said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait
hole. "I need to visit Zonko's. I'm nearly out of Stink Pellets."118Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high spirits ebbing
away. Hermione seemed to read his mind.
"Harry, I'm sure you'll be able to go next time," she said. "They're
bound to catch Black soon. He's been sighted once already."
"Black's not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade," said Ron. "Ask
McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be forages --"
"Ron!" said Hermione. "Harry's supposed to stay in school-""He can't be the only third year left behind," said Ron. "Ask
McGonagall, go on, Harry --"
"Yeah, I think I will," said Harry, making up his mind.Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt
lightly onto her lap. A large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.
"Does he have to eat that in front of us?" said Ron, scowling."Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?" said Hermione.Crookshanks; slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow eyes fixed
insolently on Ron.
"Just keep him over there, that's all," said Ron irritably, turning back
to his star chart. "1've got Scabbers asleep in my bag."
Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own
star chart to complete. He pulled his bag toward him, took outparchment, ink, and quill, and started work.
"You can copy mine, if you like," said Ron, labeling his last star with
a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry.
Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn't say
anything. Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking119the end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced.
"OY!" Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws
deep inside it and began tearing ferociously. "GET OFF, YOU STUPIDANIMAL!"
Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung
on, spitting and slashing.
"Ron, don't hurt him!" squealed Hermione; the whole common room was
watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it,and Scabbers came flying out of the top -
"CATCH THAT CAR' Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the
remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after theterrified Scabbers.
George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers
streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest ofdrawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his bandy legs,and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw.
Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around the
middle and heaved him away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, withgreat difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.
"Look at him!" he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front
of her. "He's skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!"
"Crookshanks doesn't understand it's wrong!" said Hermione, her voice
shaking. "All cats chase rats, Ron!"
"There's something funny about that animal!" said Ron, who was trying to
persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. "It heardme say that Scabbers was in my bag!"
"Oh, what rubbish," said Hermione impatiently. "Crookshanks could smell
him, Ron, how else d'you think --"
"That cat's got it in for Scabbers!" said Ron, 'ignoring the people120around him, who were starting to giggle. "And Scabbers was here first,
and he's ill!"
Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to
the boys' dormitories.
Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to
her all through Herbology, even though he, Harry, and Hermione wereworking together on the same puffapod.
"How's Scabbers?" Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods
from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail.
"He's hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking, " said Ron angrily,
missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor.
"Careful, Weasley, careful!" cried Professor Sprout as the beans burst
into bloom before their very eyes.
They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask Professor
McGonagall after the lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with therest, joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he wasgoing to argue his case. He was distracted, however, by a disturbance atthe front of the line.
Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her arm around her and
was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who werelooking very serious.
"What's the matter, Lavender?" said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry,
and Ron went to join the group.
"She got a letter from home this morning," Parvati whispered. "It's her
rabbit, Binky. He's been killed by a fox."
"Oh," said Hermione, "I'm sorry, Lavender.""I should have known!" said Lavender tragically. "You know what day it
is?"121"Er --"
"The sixteenth of October! 'That thing you're dreading, it will happen
on the sixteenth of October!' Remember? She was right, she was right!"
The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his head
seriously. Hermione hesitated; then she said, "You -- you were dreadingBinky being killed by a fox?"
"Well, not necessarily by a fox," said Lavender, looking up at Hermione
with streaming eyes, "but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn't l?"
"Oh," said Hermione. She paused again. Then"Was Binky an old rabbit?""N -- no!" sobbed Lavender. "H -- he was only a baby!"Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender's shoulders."But then, why would you dread him dying?" said Hermione.Parvati glared at her."Well, look at it logically," said Hermione, turning to the rest of the
group- "I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he? Lavender just gotthe news today-" Lavender wailed loudly. "- and she can't have beendreading it, because it's come as a real shock --"
"Don't mind Hermione, Lavender," said Ron loudly, "she doesn't think
other people's pets matter very much."
Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was
perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, andwhen they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harryand didn't talk to each other for the whole class.
Harry still hadn't decided what he was going to say to Professor
McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was shewho brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.122"One moment, please !" she called as the class made to leave. "As you're
all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me beforeHalloween. No form, no visiting the village, so don't forget!"
Neville put up his hand."Please, Professor, I -- I think I've lost"Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom," said Professor
McGonagall. "She seemed to think it was safer. Well, that's all, you mayleave."
"Ask her now," Ron hissed at Harry."Oh. but --" Hermione began."Go for it, Harry," said Ron stubbornly.Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed
nervously for Professor McGonagall's desk.
"Yes, Potter?" Harry took a deep breath."Professor, my aunt and uncle -- er -- forgot to sign my form," he said.Professor McGonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didn't
say anything.
"So -- er d'you think it would be all right mean, will It be okay if I
-- if I go to Hogsmeade?"
Professor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk."I'm afraid not, Potter," she said. "You heard what I said. No form, no
visiting the village. That's the rule."
"But -- Professor, my aunt and uncle -- you know, they're Muggles, they
don't really understand about -- about Hogwarts forms and stuff," Harrysaid, while Ron egged him on with vigorous nods. "If you said I could go123--"
"But I don't say so," said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling
her papers neatly into a drawer. "The form clearly states that theparent or guardian must give permission." She turned to look at him,with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? "I'm sorry, Potter, butthat's my final word. You had better hurry, or you'll be late for yournext lesson."
There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of
names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an"all-for-the-best" expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry hadto endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about whatthey were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade.
"There's always the feast," said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry UP.
"You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening."
"Yeah," said Harry gloomily, "great."The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if
he was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothinganyone said made him feel any better about being left behind. DeanThomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon'ssignature on the form, but as Harry had already told ProfessorMcGonagall he hadn't had it signed, that was no good. Ron halfheartedlysuggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one,reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the dementors beingable to see through them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpfulwords of comfort.
"They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it's not all
it's cracked up to be," he said seriously. "All right, the sweetshop'srather good, and Zonko's Joke Shop's frankly dangerous, and yes, theShrieking Shack's always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart fromthat, you're not missing anything."
On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to
breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his best to actnormally.124"We'll bring you. lots of sweets back from Honeydukes," said Hermione,
looking desperately sorry for him.
"Yeah, loads," said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their
squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry's difficulties.
"Don't worry about me," said Harry, in what he hoped was at, offhand
voice, "I'll see you at the feast. Have a good time."
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker,
was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a longlist, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no onewas sneaking out who shouldn't be going.
"Staying here, Potter?" shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. "Scared of passing the dementors?"
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.
"Password?" said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze."Fortuna Major," said Harry listlessly.The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common
room. It was full of chattering first and second years, and a few olderstudents, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty hadworn off
"Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!"It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and
never missed an opportunity to speak to him.
"Aren't you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not? Hey" -- Colin looked
eagerly around at his friends -- "you can come and sit with us, if youlike, Harry!"
"Er -- no, thanks, Colin," said Harry, who wasn't in the mood to have a125lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead. "I -- I've got
to go to the library, got to get some work done."
After that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out
of the portrait hole again.
"What was the point waking me up?" the Fat Lady called grumpily after
him as he walked away.
Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he
changed his mind; he didn't feel like working. He turned around and cameface-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of theHogsmeade visitors.
"What are you doing?" Filch snarled suspiciously."Nothing," said Harry truthfully."Nothing!" spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. "A likely
story! Sneaking around on your own -- why aren't you in Hogsmeade buyingStink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of yournasty little friends?"
Harry shrugged."Well, get back to your common room where you belong!" snapped Filch,
and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight.
But Harry didn't go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase,
thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walkingalong another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said,"Harry?"
Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin,
looking around his office door.
"What are you doing?" said Lupin, though in a very different voice from
Filch. "Where are Ron and Hermione?"
"Hogsmeade," said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.126"Ah," said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. "Why don't you come
in? I've just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson." "Awhat?" said Harry. I
He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank
of water. A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its facepressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindlyfingers.
"Water demon," said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully. "We
shouldn't have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trickis to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong,but very brittle."
The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle
of weeds in a corner.
"Cup of tea?" Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. "I was just
thinking of making one."
"All right," said Harry awkwardly.Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued
suddenly from the spout.
"Sit down," said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. "I've only got
teabags, I'm afraid -- but I daresay you've had enough of tea leaves?"
Harry looked at him. Lupin's eyes were twinkling."How did you know about that?" Harry asked."Professor McGonagall told me," said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug
of tea. "You're not worried, are you?"
"No," said Harry.He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he'd seen in
Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn't want Lupin to think he127was a coward, especially since Lupin alreadv seemed to think he couldn't
cope with a boggart.
Something of Harry's thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because
Lupin said, "Anything worrying you, Harry?"
"No," Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow
brandishing a fist at him. "Yes," he said suddenly, putting his tea downon Lupin's desk. "You know that day we fought the boggart?"
"Yes," said Lupin slowly."Why didn't you let me fight it?" said Harry abruptly.Lupin raised his eyebrows."I would have thought that was obvious, Harry," he said, sounding
surprised.
Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he'd done any such thing, was
taken aback.
"Why?" he said again."Well," said Lupin, frowning slightly, "I assumed that if the boggart
faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort."
Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he'd expected, but Lupin
had said Voldemort's name. The only person Harry had ever heard say thename aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.
"Clearly, I was wrong," said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. "But I
didn't think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in thestaffroom. I imagined that people would panic."
"I didn't think of Voldemort," said Harry honestly. "I -- I remembered
those dementors."
"I see," said Lupin thoughtfully. "Well, well... I'm impressed." fie
smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry's face. "That suggests128that what you fear most of all is -- fear. Very wise, Harry."
Harry didn't know what to say to that, so he drank some mot,, tea."So you've been thinking that I didn't believe you capable of fighting
the boggart?" said Lupin shrewdly.
"Well... yeah," said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier.
"Professor Lupin, you know the dementors --"
He was interrupted by a knock on the door."Come in," called Lupin.The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was
smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyesnarrowing.
"Ah, Severus," said Lupin, smiling. "Thanks very much. Could you leave
it here on the desk for me?"
Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry and
Lupin.
"I was just showing Harry my grindylow," said Lupin pleasantly, pointing
at the tank.
"Fascinating," said Snape, without looking at it. "You should drink that
directly, Lupin."
"Yes, Yes, I will," said Lupin."I made an entire cauldronful," Snape continued. "If you need more."I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.""Not at all," said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn't
like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful.
Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled.129"Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me," he said. "I
have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularlycomplex." He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. "Pity sugar makes ituseless," he added, taking a sip and shuddering.
"Why --?" Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished
question.
"I've been feeling a bit off-color," he said. "This potion is the only
thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside ProfessorSnape; there aren't many wizards who are up to making it."
Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the
goblet out of his hands.
"Professor Snape's very interested in the Dark Arts, he blurted out."Really?" said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another
gulp of potion.
"Some people reckon --" Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on,
"some people reckon he'd do anything to get the Defense Against the DarkArts job."
Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face."Disgusting," he said. "Well, Harry, I'd better get back to work. see
you at the feast later."
"Right," said Harry, putting down his empty teacup.The empty goblet was still smoking."There you go," said Ron. "We got as much as we could carry."A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry's lap. It was
dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room,pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the timeof their lives.130"Thanks," said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps.
"What's Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?"
By the sound of it -- everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding
equipment shop, Zonko's Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks forfoaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides.
"The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves,
all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to getthere!"
"Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free
samples, there's a bit, look --"
"We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three
Broomsticks --"
"Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up --""What did you do?" said Hermione, looking anxious. "Did you get any work
done?"
"No," said Harry. "Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then
Snape came in...."
He told them all about the goblet. Ron's mouth fell open."Lupin drank it?" he gasped. "Is he mad?"Hermione checked her watch."We'd better go down, you know, the feast'll be starting in fiveminutes
They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, stilldiscussing Snape.
"But if he -- you know" -- Hermione dropped her voice, glancing
nervously around -- "if he was trying to to poison Lupin -- he wouldn'thave done it in front of Harry."131"Yeah, maybe," said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed
into the Great Hall. It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds ofcandle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and manyflaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormyceiling like brilliant watersnakes.
The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting
with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harrykept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin
looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to
tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyesalong the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, orwere Snape's eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?
The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts
ghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formationgliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great successwith a reenactment of his own botched beheading.
It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry's good mood couldn't even
be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left thehall, "The dementors send their love, Potter!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the
usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor thatended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed withstudents.
"Why isn't anyone going in?" said Ron curiously.Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be
closed.
"Let me through, please," came Percy's voice, and he came bustling
importantly through the crowd. "What's the holdup here? You can't allhave forgotten the password -- excuse me, I'm Head Boy --"
And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a
chill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a132suddenly sharp voice, "Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick."
People's heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe."What's going on?" said Ginny, who had just arrived.A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the
portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, andHarry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.
"Oh, my --" Hermione grabbed Harry's arm.The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so
viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of ithad been torn away completely.
Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his
eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurryingtoward him.
"We need to find her," said Dumbledore. "Professor McGonagall, please go
to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castlefor the Fat Lady."
"You'll be lucky!" said a cackling voice.It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking
delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry.
"What do you mean, Peeves?" said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves's grin
faded a little. He didn't dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted anoily voice that was no better than his cackle. "Ashamed, Your Headship,sit. Doesn't want to be seen. She's a horrible mess. Saw her runningthrough the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between thetrees. Crying something dreadful," he said happily. "Poor thing," headded unconvincingly.
"Did she say who did it?" said Dumbledore quietly."Oh yes, Professorhead," said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a133large bombshell in his arms. "He got very angry when she wouldn't let
him in, you see." Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore frombetween his own legs. "Nasty temper he's got, that Sirius Black."
CHAPTER 9
Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall,
where they were joined ten minutes later by the students fromHufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused.
"The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,"
Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwickclosed all doors into the hall. "I'm afraid that, for your own safety,you will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to standguard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy andGirl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,"he added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important. "Sendword with one of the ghosts."
Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, "Oh,
yes, you'll be needing..."
One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the
hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floorwas covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.
"Sleep well," said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him.The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were
telling the rest of the school what had just happened.
"Everyone into their sleeping bags!" shouted Percy. "Come on, now, no
more talking! Lights out in ten minutes!"
"C'mon," Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags
and dragged them into a corner.
"Do you think Black's still in the castle?" Hermione whispered134anxiously.
"Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be," said Ron."It's very lucky he picked tonight, you know," said Hermione as they
climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves ontheir elbows to talk. "The one night we weren't in the tower...."
I reckon he's lost track of time, being on the run," said Ron. "Didn't
realize it was Halloween. Otherwise he'd have come bursting in here."
Hermione shuddered.All around them, people were asking one another the same question: "How
did he get in?"
"Maybe he knows how to Apparate," said a Ravenclaw a few feet away,
"Just appear out of thin air, you know."
"Disguised himself, probably," said a Hufflepuff fifth year. "He
could've flown in," suggested Dean Thomas.
"Honestly, am I the only person who's ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A
History?" said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron.
"Probably," said Ron. "Why?""Because the castle's protected by more than walls, You know,,, said
Hermione. "There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop peopleentering by stealth. You can't just Apparate in here. And I'd like tosee the disguise that could fool those dementors. They're guarding everysingle entrance to the grounds. They'd have seen him fly in too. AndFitch knows all the secret passages, they'll have them covered...."
"The lights are going out now!" Percy shouted. "I want everyone in their
sleeping bags and no more talking!"
The candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the
silvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to theprefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was135scattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still
filled the hall, Harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in alight wind.
Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that
everything was quiet. Around three in the morning, when many studentshad finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watchedhim looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleepingbags, telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way awayfrom Harry, Ron, and Hermlone, who quickly pretended to be asleep asDumbledore's footsteps drew nearer.
"Any sign of him, Professor?" asked Percy in a whisper."No. All well here?""Everything under control, sir.""Good. There's no point moving them all now. I've found a temporary
guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You'll be able to move themback in tomorrow."
"And the Fat Lady, sir?""Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she
refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She'sstill very distressed, but once she's calmed down, I'll have Mr. Filchrestore her."
Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps."Headmaster?" It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. "The
whole of the third floor has been searched. He's not there. And Filchhas done the dungeons; nothing there either."
"What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney's room? The
Owlery?"
"All searched."136"Very well, Severus. I didn't really expect Black to linger."
"Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?" asked Snape.Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear,"Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next."Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood;
Dumbledore's back was to him, but he could see Percy's face, rapt withattention, and Snape's profile, which looked angry.
"You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before -- ah --
the start of term?" said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, asthough trying to block Percy out of the conversation.
"I do, Severus," said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning
in his voice.
"It seems -- almost impossible -- that Black could have entered the
school without inside help. I did express my concerns whet, youappointed --"
"I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped
Black enter it," said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that thesubject was closed that Snape didn't reply. "I must go down to thedementors," said Dumbledore. I said I would inform them when our searchwas complete."
"Didn't they want to help, sit?" said Percy."Oh yes," said Dumbledore coldly. "But I'm afraid no dementor will cross
the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster."
Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly
and quietly. Snape stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with anexpression of deep resentment on his face; then he too left.
Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their eyes
open too, reflecting the starry ceiling.137"\What was all that about?" Ron mouthed.
The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The
theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder;Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology classtelling anyone who'd listen that Black could turn into a floweringshrub.
The Fat Lady's ripped canvas had been taken off the wall andReplaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony. Nobody
was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challengingpeople to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicatedpasswords, which he changed at least twice a day.
"He's a complete lunatic," said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. "Can't
we get anyone else?"
"None of the other pictures wanted the job," said Percy. "Frightened of
what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enoughto volunteer."
Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry's worries. He was now being
closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors withhim, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his mother's orders)was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To capit all, Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with such asomber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died.
"There's no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter," she said in a
very serious voice. "I know this will come as a shock to you, but SiriusBlack --"
"I know he's after me," said Harry wearily. "I heard Ron's dad telling
his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic."
Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for a
moment or two, then said, "I see! Well, in that case, Potter, you'llunderstand why I don't think it's a good idea for you to be practicing138Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only Your team members,
it's very exposed, Potter --"
"We've got our first match on Saturday!" said Harry, outraged. "I've got
to train, Professor!"
Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply
interested in the Gryffindor team's prospects; it had been she, afterall, who'd suggested him as Seeker in the first Place. He waited,holding his breath.
"Hmm..." Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at
the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. "Well... goodnessknows, I'd like to see us win the Cup at last... but all the same,Potter... I'd be happier if a teacher were present. I'll ask Madam Hoochto oversee your training sessions."
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer.
Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under theeye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session beforeSaturday's match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news.
"We're not playing Slytherin!" he told them, looking very angry.
"Flint's just been to see me. We're playing Hufflepuff instead."
"Why?" chorused the rest of the team."Flint's excuse is that their Seeker's arm's still injured," said Wood,
grinding his teeth furiously. "But it's obvious why they're doing it.Don't want to play in this weather. Think it'll damage theirchances...."
There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke,
they heard a distant rumble of thunder.
"There's nothing wrong with Malfoy's arm!" said Harry furiously. "He's
faking it!"
"I know that, but we can't prove it," said Wood bitterly, "And we've
been practicing all those moves assuming we're playing Slytherin, and139instead it's Hufflepuff, and their style's quite different. They've got
a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory --"
Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled."What?" said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior."He's that tall, good-looking one, isn't he?" said Angelina."Strong and silent," said Katie, and they started to giggle again."He's only silent because he's too thick to string two words together,"
said Fred impatiently. "I don't know why you're worried, Oliver,Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught theSnitch in about five minutes, remember?"
"We were playing in completely different conditions!" Wood shouted, his
eyes bulging slightly. "Diggory's put a very strong side together! He'san excellent Seeker! I was afraid you'd take it like this! We mustn'trelax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us! Wemust win!"
"Oliver, calm down!" said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. "We're taking
Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously."
The day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain
fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors andclassrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin teamwas looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy.
"Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!" he sighed as the gale
outside pounded the windows.
Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match
tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and givinghim tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long thatHarry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against theDark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, "Diggory'sgot a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him --"140Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts
classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.
"Sorry I'm late, Professor Lupin. I --"But it wasn't Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher's
desk; it was Snape.
"This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we'll make it ten
points from Gryffindor. Sit down."
But Harry didn't move."Where's Professor Lupin?" he said."He says he is feeling too ill to teach today," said Snape with a
twisted smile. "I believe I told you to sit down?"
But Harry stayed where he was."What's wrong with him?"Snape's black eyes glittered."Nothing life-threatening," he said, looking as though he wished it
were. "Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sitdown again, it will be fifty."
Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the
class.
"As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left
any record of the topics you have covered so far --"
"Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,"
said Hermione quickly, "and we're just about to start --"
"Be quiet," said Snape coldly. "I did not ask for information. I was
merely commenting on Professor Lupin's lack of organization."141"He's the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever had,"
said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from therest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.
"You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you -- I ,Would
expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows.Today we shall discuss --"
Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter,
which he must know they hadn't covered.
"Werewolves," said Snape."But, sir," said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, "we're
not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks --"
"Miss Granger," said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, "I was under the
impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling youall to turn to page 394." He glanced around again. 'All of you! Now!"
With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class
opened their books.
"Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and
the true wolf?" said Snape.
Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose
hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air.
"Anyone?" Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back.
"Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn't even taught you thebasic distinction between --"
"We told you," said Parvati suddenly, "we haven't got as far as
werewolves yet, we're still on --"
"Silence!" snarled Snape. "Well, well, well, I never thought I'd meet a
third-year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they sawone. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how verybehind you all are...."142"Please, sir," said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, "the
werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout ofthe werewolf --"
"That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,"
said Snape coolly. "Five more points from Gryffindor for being aninsufferable know-it-all."
Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with
her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathedSnape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them hadcalled Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermioneshe was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, "You asked usa question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to betold?"
The class knew instantly he'd gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron
slowly, and the room held its breath.
"Detention, Weasley," Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron's.
"And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, youwill be very sorry indeed."
No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made
notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and downthe rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with ProfessorLupin.
"Very poorly explained... That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly
found in Mongolia.... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? Iwouldn't have given it three...."
When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back."You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you
recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment or, thesubject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody tookthis class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange yourdetention."143Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited
until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tiradeabout Snape.
"Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the
Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job," Harry said toHermione. "Why's he got it in for Lupin? D'you think this is all becauseof the boggart?"
"I don't know," said Hermione pensively. "But I really hope Professor
Lupin gets better soon...."
Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage."D'you know what that --" (he called Snape something that made Hermione
say "Ron!") "-- is making me do? I've got to scrub out the bedpans inthe hospital wing. Without magic!" He was breathing deeply, his fistsclenched. "Why couldn't Black have hidden in Snape's office, eh? Hecould have finished him off for us!"
Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was till
dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him.Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright-- Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard inhis ear.
"What did you do that for?" said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his
cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling.
Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past
four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, butit was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds ofthe thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against thecastle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the ForbiddenForest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battlingthrough that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, gotup, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly outof the dormitory.144As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He bent
down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail anddrag him outside.
"You know, I reckon Ron was right about you," Harry told Crookshanks
suspiciously. "There are plenty of mice around this place -- go andchase them. Go on," he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiralstaircase with his foot. "Leave Scabbers alone."
The noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn. Harry knew
better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matchesweren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he wasstarting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggoryto him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger thanHarry. Seekers were usually light
and speedy, but Diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weather
because he was less likely to be blown off course.
Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up
every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up
the boys, staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time
for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.
"Stand and fight, you mangy cur!" yelled Sir Cadogan."Oh, shut up," Harry yawned.He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he'd
started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up.
"It's going to be a tough one," said Wood, who wasn't eating anything."Stop worrying, Oliver," said Alicia soothingly, "we don't mind a bit of
rain."
But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity
of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match asusual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads145bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their
hands as they went. just before he entered the locker room, Harry sawMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under anenormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.
The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood's usual
pre-match pep talk, but it didn't come. He tried to speak several times,made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckonedthem to follow him.
The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out
onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn't hear it overthe fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry's glasses.How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?
The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field,
wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to eacb other andshook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood no, looked as though he hadlockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch's mouth form the words,"Mount Your brooms.,, He pulled his right foot out of the mud with asquelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put herwhistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distantthey were off
Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He
held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.
Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able
to see his teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward andforward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with noidea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldn't hear thecommentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaksand battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated bya Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses hehadn't seen them coming.
He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his
broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decidedto come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowingwhether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the146rain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart....
With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch's
whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thickrain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into themud.
"I called for time-out!" Wood roared at his team. "Come on, under here
--"
They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took
off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.
"What's the score?""We're fifty points up," said Wood, "but unless we get the Snitch soon,
we'll be playing into the night."
"I've got no chance with these on," Harry said exasperatedly, waving his
glasses.
At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding
her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming.
"I've had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!"He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione
tapped them with her wand and said, "Impervius!"
"There!" she said, handing them back to Harry. "They'll repel water!"Wood looked as though he could have kissed her."Brilliant!" he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the
crowd. "Okay, team, let's go for it!"
Hermione's spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold,
still wetter than he'd ever been in his life, but he could see. Full offresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air,staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking147beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction....
There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked
lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to getthe Snitch quickly -
He turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at
that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, andHarry saw something that distracted him completely , the silhouette ofan enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky,motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.
Harry's numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a
few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted backinto the stands. The dog had vanished.
"Harry!" came Wood's anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts.
"Harry, behind you!"
Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and
a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them-
With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and
zoomed toward the Snitch.
"Come on!" he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face.
'Taster!"
But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the
stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. Itwas as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gonesuddenly deaf -- what was going on?
And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him,
just as he became aware of something moving on the field below...
Before he'd had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch
and looked down.148At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him,
were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were risingin his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again....Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head... a woman...
"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!""Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now....""Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --"Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain.... What was he
doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her... She was going todie.... She was going to be murdered....
He was falling, falling through the icy mist."Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy....A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew no
more.
"Lucky the ground was so soft.""I thought he was dead for sure.""But he didn't even break his glasses."Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense
whatsoever. He didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there,or what he'd been doing before he got there. All he knew was that everyinch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.
"That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life."Scariest... the scariest thing... hooded black figures... cold ...
screaming...
Harry's eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The
Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was149gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as
though they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool.
"Harry!" said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud.
"How're you feeling?"
It was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward. The lightning --
the Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors...
"What happened?" he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped."You fell off," said Fred. "Must've been -- what -- fifty feet?""We thought you'd died," said Alicia, who was shaking.Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely bloodshot."But the match," said Harry. "What happened? Are we doing a replay?"No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone."We didn't -- lose?""Diggory got the Snitch," said George. "Just after you fell. He didn't
realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on theground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair andsquare... even Wood admits it."
"Where is Wood?" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there."Still in the showers," said Fred. "We think he's trying to drown
himself."
Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred
grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.
"C'mon, Harry, you've never missed the Snitch before.""There had to be one time you didn't get it," said George.150"It's not over yet," said Fred. "We lost by a hundred points"
"Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and
Slytherin --."
"Hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points," said
George.
"But if they beat Ravenclaw...""No Way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against
Hufflepuff..."
"It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way."Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost... for the first time
ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.
After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to
leave him in peace.
"We'll come and see you later," Fred told him. "Don't beat yourself up,
Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had."
The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the
door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer toHarry's bed.
"Dumbledore was really angry," Hermione said in a quaking voice. "I've
never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell,waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground.Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.They left the stadium right away... He was furious they'd come onto thegrounds. We heard him --"
"Then he magicked you onto a stretcher," said Ron. "And walked up to
school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were --"
His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what
the dementors had done to him... about the screaming voice. He looked up151and saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quickly
cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.
"Did someone get my Nimbus?"Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other."Er --""What?" said Harry, looking from one to the other."Well... when you fell off, it got blown away," said Hermione
hesitantly.
"And?""And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow."Harry's insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree
that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.
"And?" he said, dreading the answer."Well, you know the Whomping Willow," said Ron. "It -- it doesn't like
being hit."
"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said
Hermione in a very small voice.
Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down,
and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, theonly remains of Harry's faithful, finally beaten broomstick.
CHAPTER 10
Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the
rest of the weekend. He didn't argue or complain, but he wouldn't lether throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He152knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but
Harry couldn't help it; he felt as though he'd lost one of his bestfriends.
He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent
him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, andGinny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card shehad made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under hisbowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, thistime accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort ofvoice) that he didn't blame
him in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry's bedside only at
night- But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better,because they knew only half of what was troubling him.
He hadn't told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron -and Hermione,
because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The factremained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearanceshad been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearlybeen run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from hisbroomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Washe going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for thebeast?
And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every
time he thought of them. Everyone said the dementors were horrible, butno one else collapsed every time they went near one. No one else heardechoes in their head of their dying parents.
Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had
heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hoursin the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips ofmoonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him, he heardthe last moments of his mother's life, her attempts to protect him,Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort's laughter before he murderedher.... Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rottedhands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his153mother's voice.
It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on
Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, eve', if he hadto endure Draco Malfoys taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself withglee at Gryffindor's defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, andcelebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spiritedimitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of theirnext Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ronfinally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy,which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points fromGryffindor.
"If Snape's teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I'm skiving
off," said Ron as they headed toward Lupin's classroom after lunch."Check who's in there, Hermione."
Hermione peered around the classroom door."It's okay!"Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had
been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there weredark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class asthey took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion ofcomplaints about Snape's behavior while Lupin had been ill.
"It's not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?""We don't know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment!""Did you tell Professor Snape we haven't covered them yet?" Lupin asked,
frowning slightly.
The babble broke out again."Yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn't listen --""-- two rolls of parchment!"154Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.
"Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the
essay."
"Oh no," said Hermione, looking very disappointed. "I've already
finished it!"
They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a
glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature wholooked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail andharmless looking.
"Lures travelers into bogs," said Professor Lupin as they took notes.
"You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead -peoplefollow the light -- then --"
The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the
door, Harry among them, but --
"Wait a moment, Harry," Lupin called. "I'd like a word."Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk's
box with a cloth.
"I heard about the match," said Lupin, turning back to his desk and
starting to pile books into his briefcase, "and I'm sorry about yourbroomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?"
"No," said Harry. "The tree smashed it to bits."Lupin sighed."They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at
Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touchthe trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye,and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance."155"Did you hear about the dementors too?" said Harry with difficulty.
Lupin looked at him quickly."Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that
angry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at hisrefusal to let them inside the grounds.... I suppose they were thereason you fell?"
"Yes," said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask
burst from him before he could stop himself." Why? Why do they affect melike that? Am I just --?"
"It has nothing to do with weakness," said Professor Lupin sharply, as
though he had read Harry's mind. "The dementors affect you worse thanthe others because there are horrors in your past that the others don'thave."
A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating
Lupin's gray hairs and the lines on his young face.
"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They
infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair,they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. EvenMuggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near adementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked outof you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduceyou to something like itself... soul-less and evil. You'll be left withnothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst thathappened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom.You have nothing to feel ashamed of."
"When they get near me --" Harry stared at Lupin's desk, his throat
tight. "I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum."
Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry's
shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment's Silence, then--
"Why did they have to come to the match?" said Harry bitterly.156"They're getting hungry," said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with
a snap. "Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply ofhuman prey has dried up.... I don't think they could resist the largecrowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement ... emotionsrunning high... it was their idea of a feast."
"Azkaban must be terrible," Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly."The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't
need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're alltrapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought.Most of them go mad within weeks."
"But Sirius Black escaped from them," Harry said slowly. "He got
away..."
Lupin's briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to
catch it.
"Yes," he said, straightening up, "Black must have found a way to fight
them. I wouldn't have believed it possible.... Dementors are supposed todrain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long...."
"You made that dementor on the train back off," said Harry suddenly."There are -- certain defenses one can use," said Lupin. "But there was
only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficultit becomes to resist."
"What defenses?" said Harry at once. "Can you teach me?""I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the
contrary..."
"But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able
to fight them --"
Lupin looked into Harry's determined face, hesitated, then said,
"Well... all right. I'll try and help. But it'll have to wait until next157term, I'm afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very
inconvenient time to fall ill."
What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought
that he might never have to hear his mother's death again, and the factthat Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the endof November, Harry's mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were notout of the running after all, although they could not afford to loseanother match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and workedhis team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted intoDecember. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds.Dumbledore's anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at theentrances.
Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a
dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morningcovered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz ofChristmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, hadalready decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned outto be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussingtheir plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided toremain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn't standtwo weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use thelibrary, Harry wasn't fooled; they were doing it to keep him company,and he was very grateful.
To everyone's delight except Harry's, there was to be another Hogsmeade
trip on the very last weekend of the term.
"We can do all our Christmas shopping there!" said Hermione. "Mum and
Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!"
Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind
again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decidedto spend the day reading up on the different makes. He had been ridingone of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star,which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of hisown.
On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to Ron158and Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the
marble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower. Snowhad started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very stilland quiet.
"Psst -- Harry!"He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and
George peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyedwitch.
"What are you doing?" said Harry curiously. "How come you're not going
to Hogsmeade?"
"We've come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go," said Fred,
with a mysterious wink. "Come in here...."
He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue.
Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietlyand then turned, beaming, to look at Harry.
"Early Christmas present for you, Harry," he said.Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it
on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece ofparchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred andGeorge's jokes, stared at it.
"What's that supposed to be?""This, Harry, is the secret of our success," said George, patting the
parchment fondly.
"It's a wrench, giving it to you," said Fred, "but we decided last
night, your need's greater than ours."
"Anyway, we know it by heart," said George. "We bequeath it to you. We
don't really need it anymore."
"And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?" said Harry.159"A bit of old parchment!" said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as
though Harry had mortally offended him. "Explain, George."
"Well... when we were in our first year, Harry -- young, carefree, and
innocent --"
Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been
innocent.
"Well, more innocent than we are now -- we got into a spot of bother
with Filch."
"We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason
--"
"So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the
usual --" detention disembowelment and we couldn't help noticing adrawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and HighlyDangerous.
"Don't tell me --" said Harry, starting to grin."Well, what would you've done?" said Fred. "George caused a diversion by
dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed --this."
"It's not as bad as it sounds, you know," said George. "We don't reckon
Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was,though, or he wouldn't have confiscated it."
"And you know how to work it?""Oh yes," said Fred, smirking. "This little beauty's taught us more than
all the teachers in this school."
"You're winding me up," said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of
parchment.
"Oh, are we?" said George.160He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly, and said, "I
solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider's web from the
point that George's wand had touched. They joined each other, theycrisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then wordsbegan to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, thatproclaimed:
Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and ProngsPurveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present THE
MARAUDER'S MAP
It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds.
But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it,each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bentover it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that ProfessorDumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker's cat, Mrs. Norris, wasprowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currentlybouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry's eyes traveled up anddown the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them
seemed to lead -
"Right into Hogsmeade," said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger.
"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four" -- hepointed them out -- "but we're sure we're the only ones who know aboutthese. Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor.We used it until last winter, but it's caved in -- completely blocked.And we don't reckon anyone's ever used this one, because the WhompingWillow's planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this oneleads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We've used it loads of times.And as you might've noticed, the entrance is right outside this room,through that one-eyed old crone's hump."
"Moony, Wormtaill Padfoot, and Prongs," sighed George, patting the
heading of the map. "We owe them so much."161"Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,"
said Fred solemnly.
"Right," said George briskly. "Don't forget to wipe it after you've used
it or anyone can read it," Fred said warningly.
"Just tap it again and say, 'Mischief managed!' And it'll go blank.""So, young Harry," said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy,
"mind you behave yourself."
"See you in Honeydukes," said George, winking.They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink
Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. IfFilch really didn't know... he wouldn't have to pass the dementors atall....
But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had
once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory.
Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where
it keeps its brain.
This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been
warning against.... Aids for Magical Mischief Makers... but then, Harryreasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn't asthough he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone... and Fred andGeorge had been using it for years without anything horriblehappening....
Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger.Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map,
stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom.He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Verycarefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the162one-eyed witch.
What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his
astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled HarryPotter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry wasstanding, about halfway down the third-floor corridor.
Harry watched carefully. His little Ink self appeared to be tapping the
witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand andtapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. Thetiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word insidesaid, "Dissendium."
"Dissendium!" Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.At once, the statue's hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin
person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked themap away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushedhimself forward.
He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then
landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was
pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, "Lumos! " and saw that he was
in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped itwith the tip of his wand, and muttered, "Mischief managed!" The map wentblank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then,heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off.
The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit
than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then onthe uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.
It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him.
After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harrysped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.
Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which
rose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry beganto climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he163climbed, watching his feet.... Then, without warning, his head hit
something hard.
It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his
head, listening. He couldn't hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, hepushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.
He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry
climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it -- it blended so perfectlywith the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harrycrept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he coulddefinitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and theopening and shutting of a door.
Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closer
at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.
"And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they've nearly cleaned us out
--" said a woman's voice.
A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind an
enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He heard the manshifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get anotherchance --
Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed
the stairs; looking back, he saw an enormous backside and shiny baldhead, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs,slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes-- he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.
Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked
twice at Harry. He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed alaugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley's piggy faceif he could see where Harry was now.
There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets
imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconutice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds ofchocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans,164and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that Ron
had mentioned; along yet another wall were "Special Effects" -- sweets:Droobles Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-coloredbubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splinteryToothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps ("breathe fire foryour friends!"), Ice Mice ("hear your teeth chatter and squeak!"),peppermint creams shaped like toads ("hop realistically in thestomach!"), fragile sugar-spun quills, and exploding bonbons.
Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign
hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron andHermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavoredlollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them.
"Ugh, no, Harry won't want one of those, they're for vampires, I
expect," Hermione was saying.
"How about these?" said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under
Hermione's nose.
"Definitely not," said Harry.Ron nearly dropped the jar."Harry!" squealed Hermione. "What are you doing here? How -- how did you
--?"
"Wow!" said Ron, looking very impressed, "you've learned to Apparate!""'Course I haven't," said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of
the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder'sMap.
"How come Fred and George never gave it to me!" said Ron, outraged. "I'm
their brother!"
"But Harry isn't going to keep it!" said Hermione, as though the idea
were ludicrous. "He's going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall,aren't you, Harry?"165"No, I'm not!" said Harry.
"Are you mad?" said Ron, goggling at Hermione. "Hand in something that
good?"
"If I hand it in, I'll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred
and George had nicked it!"
"But what about Sirius Black?" Hermione hissed. "He could be using one
of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers havegot to know!"
"He can't be getting in through a passage," said Harry quickly. "There
are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filchalready knows about four of them. And of the other three -- one ofthem's caved in, so no one can get through it. one of them's got theWhomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can't get out of it.And the one I just came through -well - - it's really hard to see theentrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there..."
Harry hesistated. What if Black did know the passage was there?Ron, however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a notice
pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door.
--------BY ORDER OF -------- THE MINISTRY OF MAGICCustomers are reminded that until further notice, dementors will be
patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade every night after sundown. Thismeasure has been put in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents andwill be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is thereforeadvisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall.
Merry Christmas!"See?" said Ron quietly. "I'd like to see Black try and break into
Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village. Anyway,Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, wouldn't they?They live over the shop!"166"Yes, but but --" Hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another
problem. "Look, Harry still shouldn't be coming into Hogsmeade. Hehasn't got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he'll be in so muchtrouble! And it's not nightfall yet -- what if Sirius Black turns uptoday? Now?"
"He'd have a job spotting Harry in this," said Ron, nodding through the
mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow. "Come on, Hermione, it'sChristmas. Harry deserves a break."
Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried."Are you going to report me?" Harry asked her, grinning."Oh -- of course not -- but honestly, Harry --""Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?" said Ron, grabbing him and leading
him over to their barrel. "And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fredgave me one of those when I was seven -- it burnt a hole right throughmy tongue. I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick." Ron staredbroodingly into the Acid Pop box. "Reckon Fred'd take a bit of CockroachCluster if I told him they were peanuts?"
When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of them
left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside.
Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and
shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were hollywreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in thetrees.
Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn't have his cloak. They
headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermioneshouting through their scarves.
"That's the post office"Zonko's is up there --""We could go up to the Shrieking Shack167"Tell you what," said Ron, his teeth chattering, "shall we go for a
butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?"
Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were
freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were enteringthe tiny inn.
It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A curvy sort of woman
with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlock' up at the bar.
"That's Madam Rosmerta," said Ron. "I'll get the drinks, shall I?" he
added, going slightly red.
Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, ,,her, there
was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmastree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five minuteslater, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer.
"Merry Christmas!" he said happily, raising his tankard.Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he'd ever tasted and
seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside.
A sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had
opened again. Harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked.
Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a
flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep inconversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and apinstriped cloak -- Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of
Harry's head and forced him off his stool and under the table. Drippingwith butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched his emptytankard and watched the teachers' and Fudge's feet move toward the bar,pause, then turn and walk right toward him.
Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered, Mobiliarbus!"168The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground,
drifted sideways, and landed with a soft thump right in front of theirtable, hiding them from view. Staring through the dense lower branches,Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right besidetheirs, then heard the grunts and sighs If the teachers and minister asthey sat down.
Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels,
and heard a woman's voice. "A small gillywater --"
"Mine," said Professor McGonagall's voice."Four pints of mulled mead --""Ta, Rosmerta," said Hagrid."A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella --""Mmm!" said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips."So you'll be the red currant rum, Minister.""Thank you, Rosmerta, m'dear," said Fudge's voice. "Lovely to see you
again, I must say. Have one yourself, won't you? Come and join us...."
"Well, thank you very much, Minister."Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. His heart
was pounding uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn't it occurred to himthat this was the last weekend of term for the teachers to& And how longwere they going to sit there? He needed time to sneak back intoHoneydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight.... Hermione's leggave a nervous twitch next to him.
"So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?" came Madam
Rosmerta's voice.
Harry saw the lower part of Fudge's thick body twist in his chair as
though he were checking for eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quietvoice, "What else, m'dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what169happened up at the school at Halloween?"
I did hear a rumor," admitted Madam Rosmerta."Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?" said Professor McGonagall
exasperatedly.
"Do you think Blacks still in the area, Minister?" whispered Madam
Rosmerta.
"I'm sure of it," said Fudge shortly."You know that the dementors have searched the whole village twjce?"
said Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to her voice. "Scared all mycustomers away... It's very bad for business, Minister."
"Rosmerta, dear, I don't like them any more than you do," said Fudge
uncomfortably. "Necessary precaution... unfortunate, but there YOUare.... I've just met some of them. They're in a fury against Dumbledore-- he won't let them inside the castle grounds."
"I should think not," said Professor McGonagall sharply. "How are we
supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?"
"Hear, hear!" squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling
a foot from the ground.
"All the same," demurred Fudge, "they are here to protect you all from
something much worse.... We all know what Black's capable of..."
"Do you know, I still have trouble believing it," said Madam Rosmerta
thoughtfully. "Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, SiriusBlack was the last I'd have thought... I mean, I remember him when hewas a boy at Hogwarts. If you'd told me then what he was going tobecome, I'd have said you'd had too much mead."
"You don't know the half of it, Rosmerta," said Fudge gruffly. "The
worst he did isn't widely known."
"The worst?" said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity, "Worse170than murdering all those poor people, you mean?"
"I certainly do," said Fudge."I ca'A believe that. What could possibly be worse?" "You say you
remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta," mur- mured Professor McGonagall."Do you remember who his-best friend was?"
"Naturally," said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. "Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here --ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black andJames Potter!"
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him."Precisely," said Professor McGonagall. "Black and Potter. Ringleaders
of their little gang. Both very bright, of course -- exceptionallybright, in fact -- but I don't think we've ever had such a pair oftroublemakers --"
"I dunno," chuckled Hagrid. "Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a
run fer their money."
"You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers!" chimed in Professor
Flitwick. "Inseparable!"
"Of course they were," said Fudge. "Potter trusted Black beyond all his
other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best manwhen James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harryhas no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him."
"Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-Who?" whispered
Madam Rosmerta.
"Worse even than that, rn'dear...." Fudge dropped his voice and
proceeded in a sort of low rumble. "Not many people are aware that thePotters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of courseworking tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies.One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. Headvised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't an171easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance
was the Fidelius Charm."
"How does that work?" said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest.
Professor Flitwick cleared his throat.
"An immensely complex spell," he said squeakily, "involving the magical
concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information ishidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforthimpossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses todivulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Whocould search the village where Lily and James were staying for years andnever find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against theirsitting room window!"
"So Black was the Potters' Secret-Keeper?" whispered Madam Rosmerta."Naturally," said Professor McGonagall. "James Potter told Dumbledore
that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black wasplanning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remainedworried. I remember him offering to be the Potters' Secret-Keeperhimself."
"He suspected Black?" gasped Madam Rosmerta."He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping
You-Know-Who informed of their movements," said Professor McGonagalldarkly. "Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our sidehad turned traitor and was passing a lot of information toYou-Know-Who."
"But James Potter insisted on using Black?""He did," said Fudge heavily. "And then, barely a week after the
Fidelius Charm had been performed --" "Black betrayed them?" breathedMadam Rosmerta.
"He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready
to declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to haveplanned this for the moment of the Potters' death. But, as we all know,172You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone,
horribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty positionindeed. His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, hadshown his true colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it--"
"Filthy, stinkin' turncoat!" Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar
went quiet.
"Shh!" said Professor McGonagall."I met him!" growled Hagrid. "I musta bin the last ter see him before he
killed all them people! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an'James's house after they was killed! jus' got him outta the ruins, poorlittle thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an' his parentsdead... an' Sirius Black turns up, on that flyin' motorbike he used terride. Never occurred ter me what he was doin' there. I didn' know he'dbin Lily an' James's Secret-Keeper. Thought he'd jus' heard the news o'You-Know-Who's attack an' come ter see what he could do. White an'shakin', he was. An' yeh know what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN'TRAITOR!" Hagrid roared.
"Hagrid, please!" said Professor McGonagall. "Keep your voice down!""How was I ter know he wasn' upset abou' Lily an' James? It was
You-Know-Who he cared abou'! An' then he says, 'Give Harry ter me,Hagrid, I'm his godfather, I'll look after him --' Ha! But I'd had meorders from Dumbledore, an' I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry waster go ter his aunt an' uncle's. Black argued, but in the end he gavein. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. 'I won't need itanymore,' he says.
"I shoulda known there was somethin' fishy goin' on then. He loved that
motorbike, what was he givin' it ter me for? Why wouldn' he need itanymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he'd binthe Potters' Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin' ter have ter run ferit that night, knew it was a matter o' hours before the Ministry wasafter him.
"But what if I'd given Harry to him, eh? I bet he'd 've pitched him off173the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes' friends' son! But when a wizard
goes over ter the Dark Side, there's nothin' and no one that matters toem anymore...."
A long silence followed Hagrid's story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with
some satisfaction, "But he didn't manage to disappear, did he? TheMinistry of Magic caught up with him next day!"
"Alas, if only we had," said Fudge bitterly. "It was not we who found
him. It was little Peter Pettigrew -- another of the Potters' friends.Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been thePotters' Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself."
"Pettigrew... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after
them at Hogwarts?" said Madam Rosmerta.
"Hero-worshipped Black and Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "Never
quite in their league, talent-wise. I was often rather ,harp with him.You can imagine how I -how I regret that now..." She sounded as thoughshe had a sudden head cold.
"There, now, Minerva," said Fudge kindly, "Pettigrew died a hero's
death. Eyewitnesses -- Muggles, of course, we wiped their, memorieslater -- told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing,'Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?' And then he went for his wand.Well, of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens...."
Professor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly, "Stupid boy ...
foolish boy... he was always hopeless at dueling... should have left itto the Ministry...."
"I tell yeh, if I'd got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I
wouldn't 've messed around with wands -- I'd 've ripped him limb -- from-- limb," Hagrid growled.
"You don't know what you're talking about, Hagrid," said Fudge sharply.
"Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squadwould have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I wasJunior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time,and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those174people. I -- I will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A
crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewerbelow. Bodies everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing therelaughing, with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him... a heap ofbloodstained robes and a few -- a few fragments --"
Fudge's voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five noses being
blown.
"Well, there you have it, Rosmerta," said Fudge thickly. "Black was
taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement 'Squad andPettigrew received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I think wassome comfort to his poor mother. Blades been in Azkaban ever since."
Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh."Is it true he's mad, Minister?""I wish I could say that he was," said Fudge slowly. "I certainly
believe his master's defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder ofPettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered anddesperate man -- cruel... pointless. Yet I met Black on my lastinspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sitmuttering to themselves in the dark; there's no sense in them... but Iwas shocked at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to me.It was unnerving. You'd have thought he was merely bored -- asked if I'dfinished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing thecrossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the dementorsseemed to be having on him -- and he was one of the most heavily guardedin the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day and night."
"But what do you think he's broken out to do?" said Madam Rosmerta.
"Good gracious, Minister, he isn't trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, ishe?"
I daresay that is his -- er -- eventual plan," said Fudge evasively.
"But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Whoalone and friendless is one thing... but give him back his most devotedservant, and I shudder to think how quickly he'll rise again...."175There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their
glass.
"You know, Cornelius, if you're dining with the headmaster, he'd better
head back up to the castle," said Professor McGonagall.
One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their
owners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight, and Madam Rosemerta'sglittering heels disappeared behind the bar. The door of the ThreeBroomsticks opened again, there was another flurry of snow, and theteachers had disappeared.
"Harry?"Ron's and Hermione's faces appeared under the table. They were both
staring at him, lost for words.
CHAPTER 11
Harry didn't have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back
into the Honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle oncemore. All he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time atall, and that he hardly noticed what he was doing, because his head wasstill pounding with the conversation he had just heard.
Why had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid, Mr. Weasley, Cornelius
Fudge... why hadn't anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry's parentshad died because their best friend had betrayed them?
Ron and Herinione watched Harry nervously all through dintier, not
daring to talk about what they'd overheard, because Percy was sittingclose by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded common room, itwas to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fitof end- of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn't want Fred and Georgeasking him whether he'd reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up tothe empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet. Hepushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for -- theleather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which was176full of wizard pictures of his mother and father. He sat down on his
bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages,searching, until...
He stopped on a picture of his parents' wedding day. There was his
father waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry hadinherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother, alightwith happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there ... that must be him.Their best man... Harry had never given him a thought before.
If he hadn't known it was the same person, he would never have guessed
it was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn't sunken and waxy,but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been working forVoldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he already planning thedeaths of the two people next to him? Did he realize he was facingtwelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make himunrecognizable?
But the dementors don't affect him, Harry thought, staring into the
handsome, laughing face. He doesn't have to hear my Min screaming ifthey get too close -
Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his
cabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure thehangings were hiding him from view.
The dormitory door opened."Harry?" said Ron's voice uncertainly.But Harry still, pretending to be asleep. He heard Ron leave again, and
rolled over on his back, his eyes wide open.
A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry
like poison. He could see Black laughing at him through the darkness, asthough somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes. Hewatched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, SiriusBlack blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into athousand pieces. He could hear (though having no idea what Black's voicemight sound like) a low, excited mutter. "It has happened, My Lord...177the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper and then came another
voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his headwhenever the dementors drew near....
"Harry, you -- you look terrible."Harry hadn't gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had awoken to find the
dormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to acommon room that was completely empty except for Ron, who was eating aPeppermint Toad and massaging his stomach, and Hermione, who had spreadher homework over three tables.
"Where is everyone?" said Harry."Gone! It's the first day of the holidays, remember?" said Ron, watching
Harry closely. "It's nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake youup in a minute."
Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling
outside the windows. Crookshanks was spread out in front of the firelike a large, ginger rug.
"You really don' look well, you know," Hermione said, peering anxiously
into his face.
"I'm fine," said Harry."Harry, listen," said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, you must be
really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, youmustn't go doing anything stupid."
"Like what?" said Harry."Like trying to go after Black," said Ron sharply.Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been
asleep. He didn't say anything.
"You won't, will you, Harry?" said Hermione.178"Because Black's not worth dying for," said Ron.
Harry looked at them. They didn't seem to understand at all."D'you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?"
Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive. "I can hear mymum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you'd heard your mumscreaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn't forget it ina hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend ofhers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her --"
"There's nothing you can do!" said Hermione, looking stricken. "The
dementors will catch Black and he'll go back to Azkaban and -- and servehim right!"
"You heard what Fudge said. Black isn't affected by Azkaban like normal
people are. It's not a punishment for him like it is for the others."
"So what are you saying?" said Ron, looking very tense. "You want to --
to kill Black or something?"
"Don't be silly," said Herinione in a panicky voice. "Harry doesn't want
to kill anyone, do you, Harry?"
Again, Harry didn't answer. He didn't know what he wanted to do. All he
knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, wasalmost more than he could stand.
Malfoy knows," he said abruptly. "Remember what he said to me in
Potions? 'If it was me, I'd hunt him down myself... I'd want revenge.
"You're going to take Malfoy's advice instead of ours?" said Ron
furiously. "Listen... you know what Pettigrew's mother got back afterBlack had finished with him? Dad told me -- the Order of Merlin, FirstClass, and Pettigrew's finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of himthey could find. Black's a madman, Harry, and he's dangerous --"
"Malfoy's dad must have told him," said Harry, ignoring Ron. "He was
right in Voldemort's inner circle --"179"Say You-Know-Who, will you?" interjected Ron angrily.
"-- so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort --""-- and Malfoy'd love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like
Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy's just hoping you'll get Yourself killedbefore he has to play you at Quidditch."
"Harry, please," said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, "Please
be sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don't PutYourself in danger, it's what Black wants.... Oh, Harry, you'd bePlaying right into Black's hands if you went looking for him. Your mumand dad wouldn't want you to get hurt, would they? They'd never want youto go looking for Black!"
"I'll never know what they'd have wanted, because thanks to Black, I've
never spoken to them," said Harry shortly.
There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing
his claws. Ron's pocket quivered.
"Look," said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject,
"it's the holidays! It's nearly Christmas! Let's -- let's go down andsee Hagrid. We haven't visited him for ages!"
"No!" said Hermione quickly. "Harry isn't supposed to leave the castle,
Ron --"
"Yeah, let's go," said Harry, sitting up, "and I can ask him how come he
never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!"
Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn't what Ron had had in
mind.
"Or we could have a game of chess, he said hastily, "or Gobstones. Percy
left a set --"
"No, let's visit Hagrid," said Harry firmly.So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the180portrait hole ("Stand and fight, you yellow-bellied mongrels!"), down
through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors.
They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in the
glittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloakssoaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had beenenchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid's cabin lookedlike an iced cake.
Ron knocked, but there was no answer."He's not out, is he?" said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak.Ron had his ear to the door."There's a weird noise," he said. "Listen -- is that Fang?"Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabin
came a series of low, throbbing moans.
"Think we'd better go and get someone?" said Ron nervously."Hagrid!" called Harry, thumping the door. "Hagrid, are you in there.There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid
stood there with his eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down thefront of his leather vest.
"YWve heard?" he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry's neck.Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no
laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid's weight, wasrescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm andheaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steeredinto a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, hisface glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard.
"Hagrid, what is it?" said Hermione, aghast.Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table.181"What's this, Hagrid?"
Hagrid's sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who
Picked it up and read aloud:
Dear Mr. Hagrid,Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in
your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore thatyou bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.
"Well, that's okay then, Hagrid!" said Ron, clapping Hagrid oil the
shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantichands, inviting Harry to read on.
However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question.
We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy,and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for theDisposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at theCommittee's offices in London on that date. In the meantime, thehippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated. Yours in fellowship...
There followed a list of the school governors."Oh," said Ron. "But you said Buckbeak isn't a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I
bet he'll get off
"Yeh don' know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o'
Dangerous Creatures!" choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve."They've got it in fer interestin' creatures!"
A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid's cabin made Harry, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
"I couldn' leave him tied up out there in the snow!" choked Hagrid. "All
on his own! At Christmas."182Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called "interesting creatures" andother people called "terrifying monsters." Or' the other hand, theredidn't seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid'susual standards, he was positively cute.
"You'll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid," said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid's massive forearm. "I'm sureyou can prove Buckbeak is safe."
"Won't make no diff'rence!" sobbed Hagrid. "Them Disposal devils,
they're all in Lucius Malfoy's pocket! Scared o' him! Ad if I lose thecase, Buckbeak --"
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail
and lurched forward, his face in his arms.
"What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?" said Harry."He's done more'n enough fer me already," groaned Hagrid. "Got enough on
his plate what with keepin' them dementors outta the castle, an' SiriusBlack lurkin' around --"
Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to
start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black. ButHarry couldn't bring himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid somiserable and scared.
"Listen, Hagrid," he said, "you can't give up. Hermione's right, You
just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses --"
"I'm sure I've read about a case of hippogriff-baiting," said Hermione
thoughtfully, "where the hippogriff got off I'll look it up for you,Hagrid, and see exactly what happened."
Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to
help them.
"Er -- shall I make a cup of tea?" said Ron.183Harry stared at him.
"It's what my mum does whenever someone's upset," Ron muttered,
shrugging.
At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea
in front of him, Hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of atablecloth and said, "Yer right. I can' afford to go ter pieces. Gottapull meself together.....
Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his
head on Hagrid's knee.
"I've not bin meself lately," said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand
and mopping his face with the other. "Worried abou' Buckbeak, an' no onelikin' me classes --"
"We do like them!" lied Hermione at once."Yeah, they're great!" said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table.
"Er -- how are the flobberworms?"
"Dead," said Hagrid gloomily. "Too much lettuce.""Oh no!" said Ron, his lip twitching."An' them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an' all," said Hagrid,
with a sudden shudder. "Gotta walk past 'em ev'ry time I want a drink inthe Three Broomsticks. 'S like bein' back in Azkaban --"
He fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watched him
breathlessly. They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell inAzkaban before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, "Is it awful inthere, Hagrid?"
"Yeh've no idea," said Hagrid quietly. "Never bin anywhere like it.
Thought I was goin' mad. Kep' goin' over horrible stuff in me mind...the day I got expelled from Hogwarts... day me dad died... day I had terlet Norbert go...."184His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once
won in a game of cards.
"Yeh can' really remember who yeh are after a while. An' yeh can' really
see the point o' livin' at all. I used ter hope I'd jus' die in mesleep. When they let me out, it was like bein' born again, ev'rythin' Icame floodin' back, it was the bes' feelin' in the world. Mind, thedementors weren't keen on lettin' me go."
"But you were innocent!" said Hermione.Hagrid snorted."Think that matters to them? They don' care. Long as they've got a
couple o' hundred humans stuck there with 'em, so they can leech all thehappiness out of 'em, they don' give a damn who's guilty an' who's not."
Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea. Then he said
quietly, "Thought o' jus' letting Buckbeak go... tryin' ter make him flyaway... but how d'yeh explain ter a hippogriff it's gotta go interhidin'? An' -an' I'm scared o' breakin' the law...." He looked up atthem, tears leaking down his face again. "I don' ever want ter go backter Azkaban."
The trip to Hagrid's, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the
effect Ron and Hermione had hoped. Though Harry had by no meansforgotten about Black, he couldn't brood constantly on revenge if hewanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for theDisposal of Dangerous Creatures. He, Ron, and Hermione went to thelibrary the next day and returned to the empty common room laden withbooks that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak. The three of themsat in front of the roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dustyvolumes about famous cases If marauding beasts, speaking occasionallywhen they ran across something relevant.
"Here's something... there was a case in 1722... but the hippogriff was
convicted -- ugh, look what they did to it, that's disgusting --"
"This might help, look -- a manticore savaged someone in 1296, and they
let the manticore off -- oh -- no, that was only because everyone was185too scared to go near it."
Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas
decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of thestudents remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and mistletoewere strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from insideevery suit of armor, and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelveChristmas trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and delicioussmell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it hadgrown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter ofRon's pocket to sniff hopefully at the air.
On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at him."Oy! Presents!"Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the
semi-darkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels hadappeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents.
'Another sweater from Mum... maroon again... see if you've got one.Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the
Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mincepies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved allthese things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.
"What's that?" said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of
maroon socks in his hand.
"Dunno..."Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming
broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks andjumped off his bed for a closer look.
"I don't believe it," he said hoarsely.It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see
every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He186could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at
exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from thegolden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to theperfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.
"Who sent it to you?" said Ron in a hushed voice."Look and see if there's a card," said Harry.Ron ripped apart the Firebolt's wrappings."Nothing! Blimey, who'd spend that much on you?""Well," said Harry, feeling stunned, "I'm betting it wasn't the
Dursleys."
I bet it was Dumbledore," said Ron, now walking around and around the
Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. "He sent you the InvisibilityCloak anonymously...."
"That was my dad's, though," said Harry. "Dumbledore was just Passing it
on to me. He wouldn't spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can't gogiving students stuff like this --"
"That's why he wouldn't say it was from him!" said Ron. "In case some
git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry" -- Ron gave a greatwhoop of laughter -- "Malfoy! Wait till he sees you on this! He'll besick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!"
"I can't believe this," Harry muttered, running a hand along the
Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry's bed, laughing his head off at thethought of Malfoy. "Who -?"
"I know," said Ron, controlling himself, "I know who it could've been --
Lupin!"
"What?" said Harry, now starting to laugh himself "Lupin? Listen, if he
had this much gold, he'd be able to buy himself some new robes."
"Yeah, but he likes you," said Ron. "And he was away when your Nimbus187got smashed, and he might've heard about it and decided to visit Diagon
Alley and get this for you --"
"What d'you mean, he was away?" said Harry. "He was ill when I was
playing in that match."
"Well, he wasn't in the hospital wing," said Ron. "I was there, cleaning
out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?"
Harry frowned at Ron."I can't see Lupin affording something like this.""What're you two laughing about?"Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying
Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tiedaround his neck.
"Don't bring him in here!" said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from
the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket.
But Hermione wasn't listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus's
empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.
"Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?""No idea," said Harry. "There wasn't a card or anything with it."To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or
intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit herlip.
"What's the matter with you?" said Ron."I don't know," said Hermione slowly, "but it's a bit odd, isn't it? I
mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn't it?"
Ron sighed exasperatedly.188"It's the best broom there is, Hermione," he said.
"So it must've been really expensive....""Probably cost more than all the Slytherins' brooms put together," said
Ron happily.
"Well... who'd send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even
tell him they'd sent it?" said Hermione.
"Who cares?" said Ron impatiently. "Listen, Harry, can I have a go on
it? Can I?"
"I don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet!" said Hermione
shrilly.
Harry and Ron looked at her."What d'you think Harry's going to do with it -- sweep the floor?" said
Ron.
But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus's bed,
right at Ron's chest.
"GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!" Ron bellowed as Crookshanks's claws
ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over hisshoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick atCrookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed, knocking itover and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.
Crookshanks's fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tint,, whistling was
filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from UncleVernon's old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.
I forgot about that!" Harry said, bending down and picking up the
Sneakoscope. I never wear those socks if I can help it....
The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was
hissing and spitting at it.189"You'd better take that cat out of here, Hermione," said Ron furiously,
sitting on Harry's bed nursing his toe. "Can't you shut that thing up?"he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks'syellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.
Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back
into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron's stifled moans ofpain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron's hands. It had been a whilesince Harry had seen him out of Ron's pocket, and he was unpleasantlysurprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny;patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too
"He's not looking too good, is he?" Harry said."It's stress!" said Ron. "He'd be fine if that big stupid furball left
him alone!"
But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said
about rats living only three years, couldn't help feeling that unlessScabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end ofhis life. And despite Ron's frequent conplaints that Scabbers was bothboring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbersdied.
Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor
common room that morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in herdormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron wasstill fuming about Crookshanks's fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harrygave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself toexamining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common roomwith him. For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; shedidn't say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as thoughit too had been criticizing her cat.
At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House
tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table,set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore,McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch,the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing avery old and rather moldy- looking tailcoat. There were only three other190students, two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced
Slytherin fifth year.
"Merry Christmas!" said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione
approached the table. "As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish touse the House tables.... Sit down, sit down!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table."Crackers!" said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a
large silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged.With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large,pointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vulture.
Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron's eye and they both grinned;
Snape's mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, whoswapped it for his wizard's hat at once.
"Dig in!" he advised the table, beaming around.As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great
Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them asthough on wheels. She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of theoccasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversizeddragonfly.
"Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!" said Dumbledore, standing up."I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster," said Professor Trelawney in
her mistiest, most faraway voice, "and to my astonishment, I saw myselfabandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I torefuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and Ido beg you to forgive my lateness...."
"Certainly, certainly," said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. "Let me
draw you up a chair --"
And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved
for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snapeand McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her191enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered
a kind of soft scream.
I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen!
Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dinetogether, the first to rise will be the first to die!"
"We'll risk it, Sibyll," said Professor McGonagall inpatiendy. "Do sit
down, the turkey's getting stone cold."
Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty
chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting athunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spooninto the nearest tureen.
"Tripe, Sibyll?"Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked around once
more and said, "But where is dear Professor Lupin?"
"I'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again," said Dumbledore, indicating
that everybody should start serving themselves. "Most unfortunate thatit should happen on Christmas Day."
"But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?" said Professor McGonagall,
her eyebrows raised.
Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look."Certainly I knew, Minerva, 11 she said quietly. "But one does not
parade the fact that one is All- Knowing. I frequently act as though Iam not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.
"That explains a great deal," said Professor McGonagall tartly.Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty."If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will
not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time isshort. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him --"192"Imagine that," said Professor McGonagall dryly.
I doubt," said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice,
which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney'sconversation, "that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus,you've made the potion for him again?"
"Yes, Headmaster," said Snape. "W -- what?" said Harry, scrambling to
his feet. "Why?"
"It will need to be checked for jinxes," said Professor McGonagall. "Of
course, I'm no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwickwill strip it down --"
"Strip it down?" repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad."It shouldn't take more than a few weeks," said Professor McGonagall.
"You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free."
"There's nothing wrong with it!" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly.
"Honestly, Professor --"
"You can't know that, Potter," said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly,
"not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out ofthe question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. Ishall keep you informed."
Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of
the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring afterher, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron,however, rounded on Hermione.
"What did you go running to McGonagall for?Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood
up and faced Ron defiantly.
"Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that
that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!"
CHAPTER 12
Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn't stop him from
being angry with her. He had been the owner of the best broom in theworld for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, hedidn't know whether he would ever see it again. He was positive thatthere was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of statewould it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinxtests?
Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was concerned, the
stripping-down of a brand- new Firebolt was nothing less than criminaldamage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for thebest, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she hadtaken refuge in the library and didn't try to persuade her to come back.All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortlyafter New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again.Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started.
"Had a good Christmas?" he said, and then, without waiting for an
answer, he sat down, lowered his voice, and said, "I've been, doing somethinking over Christmas, Harry. After last match, you know. If thedementors come to the next one... I mean... we can't afford you to --well --"
Wood broke off, looking awkward."I'm working on it," said Harry quickly. "Professor Lupin said he'd
train me to ward off the dementors. We should be starting this week. Hesaid he'd have time after Christmas."
"Ah," said Wood, his expression clearing. "Well, in that case -- I
really didn't want to lose you as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered anew broom yet?"
"No," said Harry.194"What! You'd better get a move on, you know -- you can't ride that
Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!"
"He got a Firebolt for Christmas," said Ron."A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A -- a real Firebolt?""Don't get excited, Oliver," said Harry gloomily. "I haven't got it
anymore. It was confiscated." And he explained all about how theFirebolt was now being checked for jinxes.
"Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?""Sirius Black" Harry said wearily. "He's supposed to be after me. So
McGonagall reckons he might have sent it."
Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his
Seeker, Wood said, "But Black couldn't have bought a Firebolt! He's onthe run! The whole country's on the lookout for him! How could he justwalk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?"
"I know," said Harry, "but McGonagall still wants to strip it down --"Wood went pale."I'll go and talk to her, Harry," he promised. "I'll make her see
reason.... A Firebolt... a real Firebolt, on our team... She wantsGryffindor to win as much as we do.... I'll make her see sense. AFirebolt..."
Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like
doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning,but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for theirenjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry woodand leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizardsscampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The firstDivination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawneywas now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harrythat he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.195It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to;
after his conversation with Wood, he wanted to get started on hisanti-dementor lessons as soon as possible.
"Ah yes," said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end
of class. "Let me see... how about eight o'clock on Thursday evening?The History of Magic classroom should be large enough.... I'll have tothink carefully about how we're going to do this.... We can't bring areal dementor into the castle to practice on...."
"Still looks ill, doesn't he?" said Ron as they walked down the
corridor, heading to dinner. "What d'you reckon's the matter with him?"
There was a loud and impatient "tuh" from behind them. It was Hermione,
who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag,which was so full of books it wouldn't close.
"And what are you tutting at us for?" said Ron irritably."Nothing," said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over her
shoulder.
"Yes, you were," said Ron. "I said I wonder what's wrong with Lupin, and
you --"
"Well, isn't it obvious?" said Hermione, with a look of maddening
superiority.
"If you don't want to tell us, don't," snapped Ron."Fine," said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off."She doesn't know," said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. "She's
just trying to get us to talk to her again."
At eight o'clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for
the History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived,but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes whenProfessor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which heheaved onto Professor Binn's desk.196"What's that?" said Harry.
"Another boggart," said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. "I've been
combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found thisone lurking inside Mr. Filch's filing cabinet. It's the nearest we'llget to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when hesees you, so we'll be able to practice on him. I can store him in myoffice when we're not using him; there's a cupboard under my desk he'lllike."
"Okay," said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at
all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for areal dementor.
"So..." Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that
Harry should do the same. "The spell I am going to try and teach you ishighly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond ordinary Wizarding Level. Itis called the Patronus Charm."
"How does it work?" said Harry nervously."Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus," said Lupin,
"which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shieldbetween you and the dementor."
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagridsized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, "The Patronus isa kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that thedementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but itcannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it.But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced foryou. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it."
"What does a Patronus look like?" said Harry curiously."Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.""And how do you conjure it?"197"With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating,
with all your might, on a single, very happy memory."
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that
had happened to him at the Dursleys' was going to do. Finally, hesettled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.
"Right," he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful,
soaring sensation of his stomach.
"The incantation is this --" Lupin cleared his throat. "Expecto
patronum!"
"Expecto patronum, " Harry repeated under his breath, "expecto
patronum."
"Concentrating hard on your happy memory?""Oh -- yeah --" said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that
first broom ride. "Expecto patrono -- no, patronum -- sorry -- expectopatronum, expecto patronum"
Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a
wisp of silvery gas.
"Did you see that?" said Harry excitedly. "Something happened!""Very good," said Lupin, smiling. "Right, then -- ready to try it on a
dementor?"
"Yes," Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into the
middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying,but something else kept intruding.... Any second now, he might hear hismother again... but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again,and he didn't want to... or did he?
Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward
Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak. The lamps around198the classroom flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from the box
and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattlingbreath. A wave of piercing cold broke over him --
"Expecto patronum!" Harry yelled. "Expecto patronum! Expecto --"But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving.... Harry was failing
again through thick white fog, and his mother's voice was louder thanever, echoing inside his head -- "Not Harry! Not Harry! please -- I'lldo anything!"
"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!""Harry!"Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor.
The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn't have to ask what hadhappened.
"Sorry," he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down
behind his glasses.
"Are you all right?" said Lupin."Yes..." Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against
it.
"Here --" Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. "Eat this before we try
again. I didn't expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I wouldhave been astounded if you had."
"It's getting worse," Harry muttered, biting off the Frog's head. "I
could hear her louder that time -- and him -- Voldemort
Lupin looked paler than usual. ,"Harry, if you don't want to continue, I will more than understand --""I do!" said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog
into his mouth. "I've got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match199against Ravenclaw? I can't afford to fall off again. If we lose this
game we've lost the Quidditch Cup!"
"All right then... " said Lupin. "You might want to select 'other
memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on.... That one doesn'tseem to have been strong enough...."
Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the
House Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. Hegripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle ofthe classroom.
"Ready?" said Lupin, gripping the box lid."Ready," said Harry; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts
about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going tohappen when the box opened.
"Go!" said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark
once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rottinghand was extending toward Harry -
"Expecto patronum!" Harry yelled. "Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat --"White fog obscured his senses... big, blurred shapes were moving around
him... then came a new voice, a man's voice, shouting, panicking --
"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off --"The sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room -- a door bursting open -- a
cackle of high- pitched laughter --
"Harry! Harry... wake up...."Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute
before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor.
"I heard my dad," Harry mumbled. "That's the first time I've ever heard
him -- he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to runfor it...."200Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with
the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on hisrobes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn't see.
"You heard James?" said Lupin in a strange voice."Yeah..." Face dry, Harry looked up. "Why -- you didn't know my dad, did
you?"
"I -- I did, as a matter of fact," said Lupin. "We were friends at
Hogwarts. Listen, Harry -- perhaps we should leave it here for tonight.This charm is ridiculously advanced.... I shouln't have suggestedputting you through this...."
"No!" said Harry. He got up again. "I'll have one more go! I'm not
thinking of happy enough things, that's what it is.... Hang on...."
He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory... one that he could
turn into a good, strong Patronus...
The moment when he'd first found out he was a wizard, and would be
leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn't a happy memory, hedidn't know what was.... Concentrating very hard on how he had felt whenhe'd realized he'd be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet andfaced the packing case once more.
"Ready?" said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his
better judgment. "Concentrating hard? All right -- go!"
He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor
rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark
'EXPECTO PATRONUM!" Harry bellowed. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!
EXPECTO PATRONUM!"
The screaming inside Harry's head had started again -- except this time,
it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio -- softerand louder and softer again -- and he could still see the dementor -- it201had halted -- and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the
end of Harry's wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and thoughHarry's legs felt like water, he was still on his feet -- though for howmuch longer, he wasn't sure --
"Riddikulus!" roared Lupin, springing forward.There was a loud crack, and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with
the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he'd justrun a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye, hesaw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case withhis wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.
"Excellent!" Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. "Excellent,
Harry! That was definitely a start!"
"Can we have another go? Just one more go?""Not now," said Lupin firmly. "You've had enough for one night. Here --"He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes' best chocolate."Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next
week?"
"Okay," said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin
extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of thedementor. A thought had just occurred to him.
"Professor Lupin?" he said. "If you knew my dad, you must've known
Sirius Black as well."
Lupin turned very quickly."What gives you that idea?" he said sharply."Nothing -- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too...."Lupin's face relaxed.202"Yes, I knew him," he said shortly. "Or I thought I did. You'd better be
off, Harry, it's getting late."
Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a
corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on itsplinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn't mentioned Black, asLupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry's thoughtswandered back to his mother and father...
He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of
chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents' last momentsreplayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heardtheir voices since he was a very small child. But he'd never be able toproduce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parentsagain....
"They're dead," he told himself sternly. "They're dead and listening to
echoes of them won't bring them back. You'd better get a grip onyourself if you want that Quidditch Cup."
He stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, and
headed back to Gryffindor Tower.
Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin
won, though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news forGryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. Hetherefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek. Thismeant that with Lupin's anti-dementor classes, which in themselves weremore draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night aweek to do all his homework. Even so, he was showing the strain nearlyas much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be gettingto her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a cornerof the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts,rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and fileupon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snappedwhen she was interrupted.
"How's she doing it?" Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat
finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry lookedup. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books.203"Doing what?"
"Getting to all her classes!" Ron said. "I heard her talking to
Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were goingon about yesterday's lesson, but Hermione can't 've been there, becauseshe was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told meshe's never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at thesame time as Divination, and she's never missed one of them either!"
Harry didn't have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione's impossible
schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape's essay.Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.
"Bad news, Harry. I've just been to see Professor McGonagall about the
Firebolt. She -- er -- got a bit shirty with me. Told m' I'd got mypriorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cupthan I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn't careif it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first." Wood shookhis head in disbelief. "Honestly, the way she was yelling at me... you'dthink I'd said something terrible... then I asked her how much longershe was going to keep it. He screwed up his face and imitated ProfessorMcGonagall's severe voice. 'As long as necessary, Wood'... I reckon it'stime you ordered a new broom, Harry. There's an order form at the backof Which Broomstick... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, likeMalfoy's got."
"I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good," said Harry flatly.January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the
bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearerand nearer, but Harry still hadn't ordered a new broom. He was nowasking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after everyTransfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermionerushing past with her face averted.
"No, Potter, you can't have it back yet," Professor McGonagall told him
the twelfth time this happened, before he'd even opened his mouth."We've checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwickbelieves the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you204once we've finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me."
To make matters even worse, Harry's anti-dementor lessons were not going
nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able toproduce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-dementorapproached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementoraway. All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining Harryof energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself,guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents' voices again.
"You're expecting too much of yourself," said Professor Lupin, sternly
in their fourth week of practice. "For a thirteen-year-old wizard, evenan indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren't passing outanymore, are you?"
I thought a Patronus would -- charge the dementors down or something,"
said Harry dispiritedly. "Make them disappear --"
"The true Patronus does do that," said Lupin. "But you've achieved a
great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in anappearance at your next Quidditch match, You will be able to keep themat bay long enough to get back to the ground."
"You said it's harder if there are loads of them," said Harry."I have complete confidence in you," said Lupin, smiling. "Here --
you've earned a drink - something from the Three Broomsticks. You won'thave tried it before --"
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase."Butterbeer!" said Harry, without thinking. "Yeah, I like that stuff!"Lupin raised an eyebrow."Oh -Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade," Harry lied
quickly.
I see," said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. "Well --
let's drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I'm205supposed to take sides, as a teacher... " he added hastily
They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he'd
been wondering for a while.
"What's under a dementor's hood?"Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully."Hmmm... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to
tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last andworst weapon."
"What's that?""They call it the Dementor's Kiss," said Lupin, with a slightly twisted
smile. "It's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. Isuppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamptheir jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out his soul."
Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer."What -- they kill --?""Oh no," said Lupin. "Much worse than that. You can exist without your
soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. Butyou'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no. .. anything.There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just exist. As an emptyshell. And your soul is gone forever... lost."
Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, "It's the fate that
awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. TheMinistry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they findhim."
Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul
sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black.
"He deserves it," he said suddenly.206"You think so?" said Lupin lightly. "Do you really think anyone deserves
that?"
"Yes," said Harry defiantly. "For... for some things..."He would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he'd
overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betrayinghis mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he'dgone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn't be veryimpressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, andleft the History of Magic classroom.
Harry half wished that he hadn't asked what was under a dementor's hood,
the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasantthoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of youthat he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.
"Do watch where you're going, Potter!""Sorry, Professor --""I've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well,
here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn'tseem to be anything wrong with it at all. You've got a very good friendsomewhere, Potter...."
Harry's jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as
magnificent as ever.
"I can have it back?" Harry said weakly. "Seriously?""Seriously," said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. "I
daresay you'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match, won'tyou? And Potter -- do try and win, won't you? Or we'll be out of therunning for the eighth year. in a row, as Professor Snape was kindenough to remind me only last night...."
Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor
Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinningfrom ear to ear.207"She gave it to You? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it?
Tomorrow?"
"Yeah... anything," said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a
month. "You know what -- we should make up with Hermione.... She wasonly trying to help...."
"Yeah, all right," said Ron. "She's in the common room how working, for
a change --"
They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville
Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing himentrance.
"I wrote them down!" Neville was saying tearfully. "But I must've
dropped them somewhere!"
"A likely tale!" roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: "Good
even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is tryingto force entry to the chambers within!"
"Oh, shut up," said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville."I've lost the passwords!" Neville told them miserably. "I made him tell
me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keepschanging them, and now I don't know what I've done with them!"
"Oddsbodikins," said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely
disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the commonroom. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and thenext moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over hisFirebolt.
"Where'd you get it, Harry?""Will you let me have a go?" "Have you ridden it yet, Harry?""Ravenclaw'll have no chance, they're all on Cleansweep Sevens!"208"Can I just hold it, Harry?"
After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was Passed around and
admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had aclear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn't rushed over to them,bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ronapproached her table and at last, she looked up.
"I got it back," said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the
Firebolt.
"See, Hermione? There wasn't anything wrong with it!" said Ron."Well -- there might have been!" said Hermione. "I mean, at least you
know now that it's safe!"
"Yeah, I suppose so," said Harry. "Id better put it upstairs.""I'll take it!" said Ron eagerly. "I've got to give Scabbers his rat
tonic."
He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass,
carried it away up the boys' staircase.
"Can I sit down, then?" Harry asked Hermione."I suppose so," said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a
chair.
Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay
on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studiesessay ("Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity" and at the runetranslation Hermione was now poring over.
"How are you getting through all this stuff?" Harry asked her."Oh, well -- you know -- working hard," said Hermione. Close-up, Harry
saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin.
"Why don't you just drop a couple of subjects?" Harry asked, watching209her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary.
"I couldn't do that!" said Hermione, looking scandalized."Arithmancy looks terrible," said Harry, picking up a very
complicated-looking number chart.
"Oh no, it's wonderful!" said Hermione earnestly. "It's my favorite
subject! It's --"
But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out.
At that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys'staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at theentrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder -- andthen Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.
"LOOK!" he bellowed, striding over to Hermione's table."LOOK!" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face."Ron, what --?""SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!"Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry
looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it.Something that looked horribly like --
"BLOOD!" Ron yelled into the stunned silence. "HE'S GONE! AND YOU
KNOWWHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?"
"N -- no," said Hermione in a trembling voice.Ron threw something down onto Hermione's rune translation. Hermione and
Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes wereseveral long, ginger cat hairs.
CHAPTER 13
It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione's friendship. Each was so
angry with the other that Harry couldn't see how they'd ever make up.
Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks's attempts to
eat Scabbers seriously, hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch onhim, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent bysuggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys' beds.Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof thatCrookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have beenthere since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her catever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron's head in the MagicalMenagerie.
Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when
he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed thatway, she lost her temper with Harry too.
"Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!" she said shrilly. "First the
Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it! just leave mealone, Harry, I've got a lot of work to do!"
Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed."Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was," said
Fred bracingly. "And he's been off-color for ages, he was wasting away.It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly -- one swallow -- heprobably didn't feel a thing."
"Fred!" said Ginny indignantly."All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself," said George."He bit Goyle for us once!" Ron said miserably. "Remember, Harry?""Yeah, that's true," said Harry."His finest hour," said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. "Let the
scar on Goyle's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. Oh,211come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what's
the point of moaning?"
In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come
along to the Gryffindor team's final practice before the Ravenclawmatch, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they'dfinished. This did seem to take Ron's mind off Scabbers for a moment("Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?") so they set off forthe Quidditch field together.
Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an
eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone elsehad been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them thebenefit of her professional opinion.
"Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it's a
slight list to the tail end -- you often find they develop a drag aftera few years. They've updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than theCleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows -- a Pity they'vestopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broomit was too...."
She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, "Er -- Madam
Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need topractice...."
"Oh -- right -- here you are, then, Potter," said Madam Hooch. "I'll sit
over here with Weasley...."
She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor
team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow'smatch.
"Harry, I've just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It's Cho
Chang. She's a fourth year, and she's pretty good.... I really hoped shewouldn't be fit, she's had some problems with injuries...." Wood scowledhis displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, "Onthe other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look likea joke next to the Firebolt." He gave Harry's broom a look of ferventadmiration, then said, "Okay, everyone, let's go -- "212And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the
ground.
It was better than he'd ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the
lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; itsped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into agreen-and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnetscreamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing thegrassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet intothe air again.
"Harry, I'm letting the Snitch out!" Wood called.Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped
it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within tenseconds had caught it tightly in his hand.
The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a
minute's head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of theothers; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell's knee, looped her easily,and caught it again.
It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the
Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and bythe time they hit the ground again, Wood didn't have a single criticismto make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.
"I can't see what's going to stop us tomorrow!" said Wood. "Not unless
-- Harry, you've sorted out your dementor problem, haven't you?"
"Yeah," said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were
stronger.
"The dementors won't turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore'd go ballistic,"
said Fred confidently.
"Well, let's hope not," said Wood. "Anyway -- good work, everyone. Let's
get back to the tower... turn in early --"213"I'm staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt," Harry told
Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms,Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and cameto meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.
"Here you go," said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed
off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge ofthe field, watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke witha start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted thatthey go back to the castle.
Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy
stadium, discussing the Firebolt's superbly smooth action, itsphenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfwaytoward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something thatmade his heart turn over -- a pair of eyes, gleaming out of thedarkness.
Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs."What's the matter?" said Ron.Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, "Lumos!"A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and
illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, wasCrookshanks.
"Get out of here!" Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone
lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshankshad vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail.
"See?" Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. "She's still
letting him wander about wherever he wants -- probably washing downScabbers with a couple of birds now...."
Harry didn't say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped
through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged214to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. slightly ashamed of
his moment of panic, Harry didn't say anything to Ron -- nor did he lookleft or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys
in his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved asort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned inthe direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excitedmuttering. Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherinteam were all looking thunderstruck.
"Did you see his face?" said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfay. "He
can't believe it! This is brilliant!"
Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt."Put it here, Harry," he said, laying the broom in the middle of the
table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. Peoplefrom the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look.Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such asuperb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy's Ravenclaw girlfriend,Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.
"Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!" said Percy heartily as she examined the
Firebolt closely. "Penelope and I have got a bet on," he told the team."Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!"
Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to
her table.
"Harry -- make sure you win," said Percy, in an urgent whisper. "I
haven't got ten Galleons. Yes, I'm coming, Penny!" And-he bustled off tojoin her in a piece of toast.
"Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?" said a cold, drawling voice.Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right
behind him.
"Yeah, reckon so," said Harry casually.215"Got plenty of special features, hasn't it?" said Malfoy, eyes
glittering maliciously. "Shame it doesn't come with a parachute -- incase you get too near a dementor."
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered."Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy," said Harry. "Then
it could catch the Snitch for you."
The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed, and he
stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team,who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry'sbroom really was a Firebolt.
At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker
rooms. The weather couldn't have been more different from their matchagainst Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze;there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, thoughnervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch matchcould bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into thestadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wandfrom his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wearunder his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn't need it. Hewondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.
"You know what we've got to do," said Wood as they prepared to leave the
locker rooms. "If we lose this match, we're out of the running. just --just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we'll be okay!"
They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw
team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field.Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She wasshorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn't help noticing,nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry asthe teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slightlurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything todo with nerves.
"Wood, Davies, shake hands," Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook216hands with the Ravenclaw Captain.
"Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three -- two -- one --"Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster
than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squintingaround for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, whichwas being provided by the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan.
"They're off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that
Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick,the Firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams atthis year's World Championship --"
"Jordan, would you mind telling us what's going on in the match?"
interrupted Professor McGonagall's voice.
"Right you are, Professor -- just giving a bit of background information
-- the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and --"
"Jordan!""Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading
for goal..."
Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a
glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. Shewas undoubtedly a very good flier -- she kept cutting across him,forcing him to change direction.
"Show her your acceleration, Harry!" Fred yelled as he whooshed past in
pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.
Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal
posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the firstgoal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he sawit -- the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of thebarriers.
Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him -- Harry was217speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was
ten feet away --
Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of
nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in thosefew, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.
There was a great "Ooooooh" of disappointment from the Gryffindor
supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end.George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludgerdirectly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over inmidair to avoid it.
"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt
go! Potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turn --Chang's Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt's precision- balanceis really noticeable in these long --"
"JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON
WITH THECOMMENTARY!"
Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put
Gryffindor only fifty points ahead -- if Cho got the Snitch before him,Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a RavenclawChaser, scanning the field frantically -- a glint of gold, a flutter oftiny wings -- the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post --
Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead -- but just
then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him --
"HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!" Wood roared as Harry
swervedto avoid a collision. "KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!"
Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had
vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twentyfeet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho followinghim.... She'd decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitchherself... All right, then... if she wanted to tail him, she'd have to218take the consequences....
He dived again, and Cho, thinking he'd seen the Snitch, tried to follow;
Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rosefast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time -- theSnitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.
He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on
the Snitch with every second -- then --
"Oh!" screamed Cho, pointing.Distracted, Harry looked down.Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at
him.
He didn't stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he
whipped out his wand and roared, "Expecto patronum!"
Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his
wand. He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn't pause towatch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead -- he wasnearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and justmanaged to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.
Madam Hooch's whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six
scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team washugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom. Down below hecould hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd.
"That's my boy!" Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all
kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though hishead would come off In complete disarray, the team managed to make itsway back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see agaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in thelead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.
"Yes!" Ron yelled, yanking Harry's arm into the air. "Yes! Yes!"219"Well done, Harry!" said Percy, looking delighted. "Ten Galleons to me!
Must find Penelope, excuse me --"
"Good for you, Harry!" roared Seamus Finnigan."Ruddy brilliant!" boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling
Gryffindors.
"That was quite some Patronus," said a voice in Harry's ear.Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and
pleased.
"The dementors didn't affect me at all!" Harry said excitedly. "I didn't
feel a thing!"
"That would be because they -- er -- weren't dementors," said Professor
Lupin. "Come and see -- "
He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of
the field.
"You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright," said Lupin.Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy,
Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, allstruggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. Itlooked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle's shoulders. Standingover them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, wasProfessor McGonagall.
"An unworthy trick!" she was shouting. "A low and cowardly attempt to
sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fiftypoints from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore aboutthis, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!"
If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor's victory, it was
this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry's side, doubled upwith laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself fromthe robe, Goyle's head still stuck inside it.220"Come on, Harry!" said George, fighting his way over. "Party! Gryffindor
common room, now!"
"Right," said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the
rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of thestadium and back up to the castle.
It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went
on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappearedfor a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles ofbutterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets.
"How did you do that?" squealed Angelina Johnson as George started
throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd.
"With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs," Fred
muttered in Harry's ear.
Only one person wasn't joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly,
was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitledHome Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke away fromthe table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottlesand went over to her.
"Did you even come to the match?" he asked her."Of course I did," said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not
looking up. "And I'm very glad we won, and I think you did really well,but I need to read this by Monday."
"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food," Harry said, looking over
at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury thehatchet.
"I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to
read!" said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. "Anyway..." Sheglanced over at Ron too. "He doesn't want me to join in."
There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly,221"If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those
Fudge Flies. He used to really like them --"
Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she
tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran towardthe staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.
"Can't you give her a break?" Harry asked Ron quietly."No," said Ron flatly. "If she just acted like she was sorry -- but
she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting likeScabbers has gone on vacation or something."
The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in
her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insistthat they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to theirdormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbedinto bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out aray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly driftingoff to sleep....
He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his
Firebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery-white. It waswinding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catchglimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he spedup, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run,and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out,and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into aclearing and -
"AAARRGGHH! NOOO!"Harry woke as suddenly as though he'd been hit in the face. Disoriented
in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings, he could hearmovements around him, and Seamus Finnigan's voice from the other side ofthe room: "What's going on?"
Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the
divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment,Dean Thomas lit his lamp.222Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of
utmost terror on his face.
"Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!""What?""Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!""You sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?" said Dean."Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!"They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first,
and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, andsleepy voices called after them.
"Who shouted?""What're you doing?"The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered
with the debris from the party. It was deserted.
"Are you sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?""I'm telling you, I saw him!""What's all the noise?""Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!"A few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling or, dressing
gowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing.
"Excellent, are we carrying on?" said Fred Weasley brightly."Everyone back upstairs!" said Percy, hurrying into the common room and
pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.223"Perce -- Sirius Black!" said Ron faintly. "In our dormitory! With a
knife! Woke me up!"
The common room went very still."Nonsense!" said Percy, looking startled. "You had too much to eat, Ron
-- had a nightmare --"
"I'm telling you --""Now, really, enough's enough!"Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as
she entered the common room and stared furiously around.
"I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting
ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!"
"I certainly didn't authorize this, Professor!" said Percy, puffing
himself up indignantly. "I was just telling them all to get back to bed!My brother Ron here had a nightmare --"
"IT WASN'T A NIGHTMARE!" Ron yelled. "PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND
SIRIUSBLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!"
Professor McGonagall stared at him."Don't be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through
the portrait hole?"
"Ask him!" said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir
Cadogan's picture. "Ask him if he saw --"
Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the Portrait
back open and went outside. The whole common room listened with batedbreath. "Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?""Certainly, good lady!" cried Sir Cadogan.224There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.
"You -- you did?" said Professor McGonagall. "But -- but the password!""He had 'em!" said Sir Cadogan proudly. "Had the whole week's, my lady!
Read 'em off a little piece of paper!"
Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to
face the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk.
"Which person," she said, her voice shaking, "which abysmally foolish
person wrote down this week's passwords and left them lying around?"
There was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks.
Neville Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes, raisedhis hand slowly into the air.
CHAPTER 14
No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle
was being searched again, and the whole House stayed awake in the commonroom, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. ProfessorMcGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped.
Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter
security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors torecognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustlingup and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks inthe walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait hadbeen taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the FatLady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremelynervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that shewas given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had beenhired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talkingin grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.
Harry couldn't help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on
the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred225and George had been right in thinking that they -- and now Harry, Ron,
and Hermione -- were the only ones who knew about the hidden passagewaywithin it.
"D'you reckon we should tell someone?" Harry asked Ron."We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's," said Ron dismissively.
"We'd've heard if the shop had been broken into."
Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up
too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again.
Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life,
people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clearthat Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though still severelyshaken by the night's events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked whathad happened, with a wealth of detail.
"... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was
in my dream, you know? But then there was this draft... I woke up andone side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down.... I rolledover... and I saw him standing over me... like a skeleton, with loads offilthy hair ... holding this great long knife, must've been twelveinches... and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled,and he scampered.
"Why, though?" Ron added to Harry as the group of secondyear girls who
had been listening to his chilling tale departed. "Why did he run?"
Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the
wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had provedtwelve years ago that he didn't mind murdering innocent people, and thistime he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.
"He must've known he'd have a job getting back out of the castle once
you'd yelled and woken people up," said Harry thoughtfully. "He'd've hadto kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole... then hewould' ve met the teachers...."
Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with226him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a
detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower.Poor Neville was forced to wait. outside the common room every night forsomebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly athim. None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the onehis grandmother had in store for him. Two days after Black's break-in,she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receiveover breakfast -- a Howler.
The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual,
and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarletenvelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting oppositehim, recognized the letter as a Howler at once -- Ron had got one fromhis mother the year before.
"Run for it, Neville," Ron advised.Neville didn't need telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding
it before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherintable exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They heard the Howlergo off in the entrance hall -- Neville's grandmother's voice, magicallymagnified to a hundred times its Usual volume, shrieking about how hehad brought shame on the whole family.
Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that
he had a letter too. Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply onthe wrist.
"Ouch! Oh -- thanks, Hedwig."Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of
Neville's cornflakes. The note inside said:
Dear Harry and Ron, How Abut having tea with me this afternoon 'round
six? I'll come collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCEHALL; YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. Cheers, Hagrid
"He probably wants to hear all about Black!" said Ron.So at six o'clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left Gryffindor Tower,227passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance
hall.
Hagrid was already waiting for them."All right, Hagrid!" said Ron. "S'pose you want to hear about Saturday
night, do you?"
"I've already heard all abou' it," said Hagrid, opening the front doors
and leading them outside.
"Oh," said Ron, looking slightly put out.The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid's cabin was Buckbeak, who
was stretched out on top of Hagrid's patchwork quilt, his enormous wingsfolded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets.Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic,hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging fromthe top of Hagrid's wardrobe door.
"What are they for, Hagrid?" said Harry."Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous
Creatures," said Hagrid. "This Friday. Him an' me'll be goin' down terLondon together. I've booked two beds on the Knight Bus...."
Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that
Buckbeak's trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron'sface, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helpinghim prepare Buckbeak's defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had drivenit clean out of their minds.
Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they
knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience withHagrid's cooking.
I got somethin' ter discuss with you two," said Hagrid, sitting himself
between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.
"What?" said Harry.228"Hermione," said Hagrid.
"What about her?" said Ron."She's in a righ' state, that's what. She's bin comin' down ter visit me
a lot since Chris'mas. Bin feelin' lonely. Firs' yeh weren' talking toher because o' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin' to her because her cat--"
"-- ate Scabbers!" Ron interjected angrily."Because her cat acted like all cats do," Hagrid continued doggedly.
"She's cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin' through a rough time atthe moment. Bitten off more'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the workshe's tryin' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak's case,mind.... She's found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he'll standa good chance now..."
"Hagrid, we should've helped as well -- sorry --" Harry began awkwardly."I'm not blamin' yeh!" said Hagrid, waving Harry's apology aside. "Gawd
knows yeh've had enough ter be gettin' on with. I've seen yeh practicin'Quidditch ev'ry hour o' the day an' night -- but I gotta tell yeh, Ithought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats. Tha'sall."
Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks."Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She's got
her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an' you two not talkin' toher --"
"If she'd just get rid of that cat, I'd speak to her again!" Ron said
angrily. "But she's still sticking up for it! It's a maniac, and shewon't hear a word against it!"
"Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou' their pets," said Hagrid
wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid'spillow.229They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor's improved
chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o'clock, Hagrid walked them backup to the castle.
A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they
returned to the common room.
"Hogsmeade, next weekend!" said Ron, craning over the heads to read the
new notice. "What d'you reckon?" he added quietly to Harry as they wentto sit down.
"Well, Filch hasn't done anything about the passage into Honeydukes...."
Harry said, even more quietly.
"Harry!" said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around
at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearinga space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.
"Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall
about that map!" said Hermione.
"Can you hear someone talking, Harry?" growled Ron, not looking at
Hermione.
"Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly
did to you! I mean it, I'll tell --"
"So now you're trying to get Harry expelled!" said Ron furiously.
"Haven't you done enough damage this year?"
Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks
leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expressionon Ron's face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward thegirls' dormitories.
"So how about it?" Ron said to Harry as though there had been no
interruption. "Come on, last time we went you didn't see anything. Youhaven't even been inside Zonko's yet!"230Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.
"Okay," he said. "But I'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time."On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag,
slipped the Marauder's Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfastwith everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down thetable at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see himwalking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybodyelse proceeded to the front doors.
"'Bye!" Harry called to Ron. "See you when you get back!"Ron grinned and winked.Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder's Map out of
his pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothedit out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it.The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom.
Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, "Dissendium!" and shoved
his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Nevillecame around the corner.
"Harry! I forgot you weren't going to Hogsmeade either!""Hi, Neville," said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and
pushing the map back into his pocket. "What are you up to?"
"Nothing," shrugged Neville. "Want a game of Exploding Snap?""Er -- not now -- I was going to go to the library and do that vampire
essay for Lupin --"
"I'll come with you!" said Neville brightly. I haven't done it either!""Er -- hang on -- yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!""Great, you can help me!" said Neville, his round face anxious. "I don't
understand that thing about the garlic at all -- do they have to eat it,231or --"
He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry's shoulder.It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry."And what are you two doing here?" said Snape, coming to a halt and
looking from one to the other. "An odd place to meet --"
To Harry's immense disquiet, Snape's black eyes flicked to the doorways
on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.
"We're not -- meeting here," said Harry. "We just -- met here.""Indeed?" said Snape. "You have a habit of turning up in unexpected
places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason.... Isuggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong."
Harry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned the
corner, Harry looked back. Snape was running one of his hands over theone-eyed witch's head, examining it closely.
Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the
password, then pretending he'd left his vampire essay in the library anddoubling back. Once out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled outthe map again and held it close to his nose.
The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry scanned the map
carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeledSeverus Snape was now back in its office.
He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved himself
inside, and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute.He wiped the Marauder's Map blank again, then set off at a run.
Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into
the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back.
It's me," he muttered.232"What kept you?" Ron hissed.
"Snape was hanging around."They set off up the High Street."Where are you?" Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth. "Are
you still there? This feels weird...."
They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of
an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. Theowls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of them;from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls ("Local DeliveriesOnly"), which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry'shand.
Then they visited Zonko's, which was so packed with students Harry had
to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. Therewere jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred's and George's wildestdreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold fromunder the cloak. They left Zonko's with their money bags considerablylighter than they had been on entering, but their pockets bulging withDungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacupapiece.
The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying
indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slopeto visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. Itstood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylightwas slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.
"Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it," said Ron as they leaned on the
fence, looking up at it. "I asked Nearly Headless Nick... he says he'sheard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and Georgetried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut...."
Harry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the
cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. Someone wasclimbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; momentslater, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy233was speaking.
"... should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the
hearing to tell them about my arm... about how I couldn't use it forthree months...."
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered."I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend
himself... 'There's no 'arm in 'im, 'onest that hippogriff's as good asdead --"
Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent
grin.
"What are you doing, Weasley?"Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron."Suppose You'd love to live here, wouldn't you, Weasley? Dreaming about
having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room -- isthat true?"
Harry seized the back of Ron's robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy.
"Leave him to me," he hissed in Ron's ear.
The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently around
behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handfulof mud out of the path.
"We were just discussing your friend Hagrid," Malfoy said to Ron. "Just
trying to imagine what he's saying to the Committee for the Disposal ofDangerous Creatures. D'you think he'll cry when they cut off hishippogriff's
SPLAT.Malfoy's head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silverblond hair
was suddenly dripping in muck.234"What the --?"
Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing
so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staringwildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.
"What was that? 'Who did that?""Very haunted up here, isn't it?" said Ron, with the air of one
commenting on the weather.
Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles were no use
against ghosts. Malfoy was staring madly around at the desertedlandscape.
Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded
some foul-smelling, green sludge.
SPLATTER.Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle hopped furiously on the
spot, trying to rub it out of his small, dull eyes.
"It came from over there!" said Malfoy, wiping his face, and staring at
a spot some six feet to the left of Harry.
Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie.
Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe'sback. Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind ofpirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was theonly person Crabbe could see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harrystuck out his leg. Crabbe stumbled -- and his huge, flat foot caught thehem of Harry's cloak. Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid offhis face.
For a split second, Malfoy stared at him."AAARGH!" he yelled, pointing at Harry's head. Then he turned tail and
ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behindhim.235Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done.
"Harry!" Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point
where Harry had disappeared, "you'd better run for it! If Malfoy tellsanyone -- you'd better get back to the castle, quick --" "See youlater," said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down the pathtoward Hogsmeade.
Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would anyone believeMalfoy? Nobody knew about the Invisibility Cloak -- nobody except
Dumbledore. Harry's stomach turned over -- Dumbledore would know exactlywhat had happened, if Malfoy said any- thing --
Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone
floor, through the trapdoor -- Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked itunder his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage.... Malfoy would getback first... how long would it take him to find a teacher? Panting, asharp pain in his side, Harry didn't slow down until he reached thestone slide. He would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was toomuch of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher -- he hid itin a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweatyhands slipping on the sides of the chute. He reached the inside of thewitch's hump, tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through, andhoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out frombehind the statue, he heard quick footsteps approaching.
It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black robes
swishing, then stopped in front of him.
"So," he said.There was a look of surpressed triumph about him. Harry tried to look
innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which hequickly hid in his pockets.
"Come with me, Potter," said Snape.Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on the236inside of his robes without Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs
to the dungeons and then into Snape's office.
Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious
trouble then too. Snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things injars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glintingin the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.
"Sit," said Snape.Harry sat. Snape, however, remained, standing."Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter," said
Snape.
Harry didn't say anything."He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into
Weasley -- apparently alone."
Still, Harry didn't speak."Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large
amount of mud hit him in the back of the head. How do you think thatcould have happened?"
Harry tried to look mildly surprised."I don't know, Professor."Snape's eyes were boring into Harry's. It was exactly like trying to
stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.
"Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what
it might have been, Potter?"
"No," said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious."It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair."237There was a long silence.
"Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey," said Harry. "If he's seeing
things like --"
"What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?" said Snape
softly. "Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body haspermission to be in Hogsmeade."
"I know that," said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or
fear. "It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --"
"Malfoy is not having hallucinations," snarled Snape, and he bent down,
a hand on each arm of Harry's chair, so that their faces were a footapart. "If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you."
"I've been up in Gryffindor Tower," said Harry. "Like you told --" "Can
anyone confirm that?"
Harry didn't say anything. Snape's thin mouth curled into a horrible
smile.
"So," he said, straightening up again. "Everyone from the Minister of
Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe fromSirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself Let theordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes wherehe wants to, with no thought for the consequences.
Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the
truth. He wasn't going to do it. Snape had no proof -- yet.
"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter," Snape said
suddenly, his eyes glinting. "He too was exceedingly arrogant. A smallamount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cutabove the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friendsand admirers... The resemblance between you is uncanny."
"My dad didn't strut," said Harry, before he could stop himself. "And
neither do I."238"Your father didn't set much store by rules either," Snape went on,
pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. "Rules were forlesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen --"
"SHUT UP!"Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his
last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He didn't care thatSnape's face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.
"What did you say to me, Potter?""I told you to shut up about my dad!" Harry yelled. I know the truth,
all right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn't even behere if it wasn't for my dad!"
Snape's sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk."And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father
saved my life?" he whispered. "Or did he consider the details toounpleasant for precious Potter's delicate ears?"
Harry bit his lip. He didn't know what had happened and didn't want to
admit it -- but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth.
I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father,
Potter," he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. "Have you beenimagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you -- yoursaintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me thatwould have resulted in my death if your father hadn't got cold feet atthe last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He wassaving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he wouldhave been expelled from Hogwarts."
Snape's uneven, yellowish teeth were bared."Turn out your pockets, Potter!" he spat suddenly.Harry didn't move. There was a pounding in his ears.239"Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them
out, Potter!"
Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko's tricks and
the Marauder's Map.
Snap picked up the Zonko's bag."Ron gave them to me," said Harry, praying he'd get a chance to tip Ron
off before Snape saw him. "He -brought them back from Hogsmeade lasttime --"
"Indeed? And you've been carrying them around ever since? How very
touching... and what is this?"
Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his
face impassive.
"Spare bit of parchment," he said with a shrug.Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry."Surely you don't need such a very old piece of parchment?" he said.
"Why don't I just -- throw this away?"
His hand moved toward the fire."No!" Harry said quickly."So!" said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. "Is this another
treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it -- something else? A letter,perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or -- instructions to get intoHogsmeade without passing the dementors?"
Harry blinked. Snape's eyes gleamed."Let me see, let me see...." he muttered, taking out his wand and
smoothing the map out on his desk. "Reveal your secret!" he said,touching the wand to the parchment.240Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.
"Show yourself!" Snape said, tapping the map sharply.It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths."Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield
the information you conceal!" Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.
As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the
smooth surface of the map.
Mooney presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep
his abnormally large nose out of other people's business."
Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map
didn't stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first.
"Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony and would like to add that Professor
Snape is an ugle git."
It would have been very funny if the situation hadn't been so serious.
And there was more....
"Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like
that ever became a professor."
Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he'd opened them, the map had had
its last word.
"Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his
hair , the slimeball."
Harry waited for the blow to fall."So..." said Snape softly. "We'll see about this...."He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from
a jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames.241"Lupin!" Snape called into the fire. "I want a word!"
Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared
in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin wasclambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.
"You called, Severus?" said Lupin mildly."I certainly did," said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode
back to his desk. "I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He wascarrying this."
Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony,
Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closedexpression appeared on Lupin's face.
"Well?" said Snape.Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin
was doing some very quick thinking.
"Well?" said Snape again. "This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic.
This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do youimagine Potter got such a thing?"
Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry's direction,
warned him not to interrupt.
"Full of Dark Magic?" he repeated mildly. "Do you really think so,
Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment thatinsults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? Iimagine Harry got it from a joke shop --"
"Indeed?" said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. "You think a
joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You don't think it morelikely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?"
Harry didn't understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently,
did Lupin.242"You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?" he said. "Harry, do
you know any of these men?"
"No," said Harry quickly."You see, Severus?" said Lupin, turning back to Snape. "It looks like a
Zonko product to me --"
Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out
of breath, and stopped just short of Snape's desk, clutching the stitchin his chest and trying to speak.
"I -- gave -- Harry -- that -- stuff," he choked. "Bought -- it... in
Zonko's... ages -- ago..."
"Well!" said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around
cheerfully. "That seems to clear that up! Severus, I'll take this back,shall I?" He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. "Harry, Ron,come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay -- excuse us, Severus--"
Harry didn't dare look at Snape as they left his office. He. Ron, and
Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking.Then Harry turned to Lupin.
"Professor, I --""I don't want to hear explanations," said Lupin shortly. He glanced
around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. "I happen to knowthat this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I knowit' s a map," he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. "I don't want toknow how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that youdidn't hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time astudent left information about the castle lying around. And I can't letyou have it back, Harry."
Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest."Why did Snape think I'd got it from the manufacturers?"243"Because...," Lupin hesitated, "because these mapmakers would have
wanted to lure you out of school. They'd think it extremelyentertaining."
"Do you know them?" said Harry, impressed."We've met," he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously
than ever before.
"Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you
take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you haveheard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effecton you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poorway to repay them -- gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magictricks."
He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any
point in Snape's office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marblestaircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered theInvisibility Cloak -- it was still down there, but he didn't dare go andget it.
"It's my fault," said Ron abruptly. "I persuaded you to go. Lupin's
right, it was stupid, we shouldn't've done it --"
He broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were
pacing, and Hermione was walking toward them. One look at her faceconvinced Harry that she had heard what had happened. His heartplummeted -- had she told Professor McGonagall?
"Come to have a good gloat?" said Ron savagely as she stopped in front
of them. "Or have you just been to tell on us?"
"No," said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip
was trembling. "I just thought you ought to know... Hagrid lost hiscase. Buckbeak is going to be executed."
CHAPTER 15
He sent me this," Hermione said, holding out the letter.
Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had
smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read.
Dear Hermione, We lost. I'm allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts.
Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London. I won't forget allthe help you gave us.
Hagrid"They can't do this," said Harry. "They can't. Buckbeak isn't
dangerous."
"Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it," said Hermione, wiping
her eyes. "You know what he's like. They're a bunch of doddery oldfools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there alwaysis. Only I can't see any hope.... Nothing will have changed."
"Yeah, it will," said Ron fiercely. "You won't have to do all the work
alone this time, Hermione. I'll help."
"Oh, Ron!"Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely.
Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top ofthe head. Finally, Hermione drew away.
"Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers..." she sobbed."Oh -- well -- he was old," said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that
she had let go of him. "And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mumand Dad might get me an owl now."
The safety measures imposed on the students since Black's second
break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visitHagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was duringCare of Magical Creatures lessons.245He seemed numb with shock at the verdict.
"S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in
black robes an' I kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them datesyeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an' saidhis bit, and the Committee jus' did exac'ly what he told 'em...."
"There's still the appeal!" said Ron fiercely. "Don't give up Yet, we're
working on it!"
They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class.
Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, andkept looking back, laughing derisively.
"S'no good, Ron," said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps.
"That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket. I'm jus' gonna make surethe rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had. I owe himthat...."
Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried
in his handkerchief.
"Look at him blubber!"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle
doors, listening.
"Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?" said Malfoy. "And he's
supposed to be our teacher!"
Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got
there first -- SMACK!
She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could
muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stoodflabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.
"Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul -- you evil --""Hermione!" said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung246it back.
"Get off, Ron!"Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle
looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.
"C'mon," Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had
disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons.
"Hermione!" Ron said again, sounding both stunned and irnpressed."Harry, you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final!" Hermione said
shrilly. "You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherinwins!"
"We're due in Charms," said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. "We'd
better go."
They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's
classroom.
"You're late, boys!" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened
the classroom door. "Come along, quickly, wands out, we're experimentingwith Cheering Charms today, we've already divided into pairs --"
Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron
looked behind him.
"Where's Hermione gone?"Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet
Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door.
"That's weird," said Harry, staring at Ron. "Maybe -- maybe she went to
the bathroom or something?"
But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson."She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too," said Ron as the247class left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had
left them with a feeling of great contentment.
Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished their
apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off,and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried.
"You don't think Malfoy did something to her?" Ron said anxiously as
they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.
They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password
("Flibbertigibbet"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into thecommon room.
Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an
open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harryprodded her awake.
"Wh -- what?" said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly
around. "Is it time to go? W -- which lesson have we got now?"
"Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes," said Harry.
"Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?"
"What? Oh no!" Hermione squeaked. "I forgot to go to Charms!""But how could you forget?" said Harry. "You were with us till we were
right outside the classroom!"
"I don't believe it!" Hermione wailed. "Was Professor Flitwick angry?
Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!"
"You know what, Hermione?" said Ron, looking down at the enormous
Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. "I reckon you'recracking up. You're trying to do too much."
"No, I'm not!" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and
staring hopelessly around for her bag. "I just made a mistake, that'sall! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry... I'll seeyou in Divination!"248Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawneys
classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed.
"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our
exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!"
Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room.
Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly whitemist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same ricketytable.
"I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term," Ron
muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case shewas lurking nearby.
"Don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry," Harry muttered
back. "I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at myhands."
"Good day to you!" said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor
Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvatiand Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glowof their crystal ball.
"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I
had planned," said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to thefire and gazing around. "The fates have informed me that yourexamination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give yousufficient practice."
Hermione snorted."Well, honestly... 'the fates have informed her' who sets the exam? She
does! What an amazing prediction!" she said, not troubling to keep hervoice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.
It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them as her
face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she hadnot.249"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art," she said dreamily. "I do
not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinitedepths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind andexternal eyes" -- Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuffhis fist in his mouth to stifle the noise -- "so as to clear the InnerEye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you willsee before the end of the class."
And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring
blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughtssuch as "this is stupid" kept drifting across it. It didn't help thatRon kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.
"Seen anything yet?" Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour's quiet
crystal gazing.
"Yeah, there's a burn on this table," said Ron, pointing. "Someone's
spilled their candle."
"This is such a waste of time," Hermione hissed. "I could be practicing
something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms --"
Professor Trelawney rustled past."Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within
their Orb?" she murmured over the clinking of her bangles.
I don't need help," Ron whispered. "It's obvious what this means.
There's going to be loads of fog tonight."
Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing."Now, really!" said Professor Trelawney as everyone's heads turned in
their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. "You aredisturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!" She approached their table andpeered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He wassure he knew what was coming --
"There is something here!" Professor Trelawney whispered, lowerng her250face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses.
"Something moving... but what is it?"
Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, Including his Firebolt,
that it wasn't good news, whatever it was. And sure enough --
"My dear Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. "It is here,
plainer than ever before... my dear, stalking toward you, growing evercloser... the Gr --"
"Oh, for goodness' sake!" said Hermione loudly. "Not that ridiculous
Grim again!"
Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione's face. Parvati
whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too.Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakableanger.
"I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class
my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art ofDivination requires. Indeed, I don't remember ever meeting a studentwhose mind was so hopelessly mundane."
There was a moment's silence. Then --"Fine!" said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the
Future back into her bag. "Fine!" she repeated, swinging the bag overher shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. "I give up! I'mleaving!"
And to the whole class's amazement, Hermione strode over to the
trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight.
It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor
Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turnedabruptly from Harry and Ron's table, breathing rather heavily as shetugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.
"Ooooo!" said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. "Ooooo,
Professor Trelawney, I've just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn't251you? Didn't you, Professor? 'Around Easter, one of our number will leave
us forever!' You said it ages ago, Professor!"
Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile."Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us.
One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs.... The InnerEye can be a burden, you know..."
Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that
Professor Trelawney could join their table instead.
"Some day Hermione's having, eh?" Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed."Yeah..."Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white
mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? Thelast thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditchfinal drawing ever nearer.
The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never
had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervouscollapse, and he wasn't the only one.
"Call this a holiday!" Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one
afternoon. "The exams are ages away, what're they playing at?"
But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she
was taking more subjects than anybody else. She was usually last toleave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the nextmorning; she had shadows like Lupin's under her eyes, and seemedconstantly close to tears.
Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal. When he wasn't
doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes withnames like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? AStudy of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so absorbed, he even forgot to behorrible to Crookshanks.252Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice
every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. TheGryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday afterthe Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly twohundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) thatthey needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. Italso meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, becausecapturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points.
"So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up," Wood
told Harry constantly. "Only if we're more than fifty points up, Harry,or we win the match but lose the Cup. You've got that, Haven't you? Youmust catch the Snitch only if we're --"
"I KNOW, OLIVER!" Harry yelled.The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match.
Gryffindor hadn't won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary CharlieWeasley (Ron's second oldest brother) had been seeker. But Harry doubtedwhether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. Theenmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoywas still smarting ,bout the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and waseven more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out ofpunishment. Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage him inthe match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that madehim most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.
Never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highly
charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension betweenthe two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number ofsmall scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nastyincident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth yearended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.
Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn't walk to
class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip himup; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouchingaway looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people. Woodhad given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere hewent, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole253of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it
was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he wassurrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for hisFirebolt's safety than his own. When he wasn't flying it, he locked itsecurely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Towerat break times to check that it was still there.
All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the
night before the match. Even Hermione had Put down her books.
"I can't work, I can't concentrate," she said nervously.There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing
with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. OliverWood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner,prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himselfAngelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred's and George's jokes.Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center ofthings, trying not to think about the next day, because every time hedid, he had the horrible sensation that something very large wasfighting to get out of his stomach.
"You're going to be fine," Hermione told him, though she looked
positively terrified.
"You've got a Firebolt!" said Ron."Yeah..." said Harry, his stomach writhing.It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, "Team! Bed!"Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood
was yelling, "Where were you? We had to use Neville instead!" Then hedreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for thematch riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoida spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth, when he realized he hadforgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and woke with a start.
It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn't taken
place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team254definitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very
thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went topour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window.
The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the
treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless andinnocent-looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match wouldbe perfect.
Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when
something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across thesilvery lawn.
Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them
on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn't be the Grim -- not now-- not right before the match -
He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute's frantic
searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now... Itwasn't the Grim at all ... it was a cat.... Harry clutched the windowledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was onlyCrookshanks....
Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat
against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry wassure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.
And just then, it emerged -- a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving
stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harrystared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well,how could it be an omen of Harry's death?
"Ron!" Harry hissed. "Ron! Wake up!""Huh?"I need you to tell me if you can see something!""S'all dark, Harry," Ron muttered thickly. "What're you or, about?"255"Down here --"
Harry looked quickly back out of the window.Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill
to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren'tthere. Where had they gone?
A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the
next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn't help grinning broadly ashe saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applaudingthem too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harrynoticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual.
Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching
nothing himself Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone elsehad finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they leftthe Great Hall, everyone applauded again.
"Good luck, Harry!" called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing."Okay -- no wind to speak of -- sun's a bit bright, that could impair
your vision, watch out for it -- ground's fairly hard, good, that'llgive us a fast kickoff --"
Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally,
they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the restof the school spilling onto the lawn.
"Locker rooms," said Wood tersely.None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry
wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he'd eatensomething extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no timeat all, Wood was saying, "Okay, it's time, let's go --"
They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Threequarters
of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the256Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like "GO
GRYFFINDOR!" and "LIONS FOR THE CUK' Behind the Slytherin goal posts,however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent ofSlytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the veryfront row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.
"And here are the Gryffindors!" yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as
commentator as usual. "Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley,and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in agood few years --"
Lee's comments were drowned by a tide of "boos" from the Slytherin end."And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He's Made some
changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill--"
More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a
point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person On the Slytherin team; therest of them were enormous.
"Captains, shake hands!" said Madam Hooch.Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other's hand very
tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other'sfingers.
"Mount your brooms!" said Madam Hooch. "Three... two... one..."The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen
brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead;his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, sawMalfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.
"And it's Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinner of Gryffindor with
the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, lookinggood, Alicia! Argh, no -- Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warringtonof Slytherin tearing UP the field -- WHAM! -- nice Bludger work there byGeorge Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it's caught by -- Johnson,Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina -- nice swerve around257Montague -- duck, Angelina, that's a Bludger!- SHE SCORES! TEN-ZERO TO
GRYFFINDOR!"
Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the
sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight
"OUCH!"Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing
into her.
"Sorry!" said Flint as the crowd below booed. "Sorry, didn't see her!"A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater's club at the back of
Flint's head. Flint's nose smashed into the handle of his broom andbegan to bleed.
"That will do!" shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between then. "Penalty
shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penaltyshot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!"
"Come off it, Miss!" howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and
Alicia flew forward to take the penalty.
"Come on, Alicia!" yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the
crowd. "YES! SHE'S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TOGRYFFINDOR!"
Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely,
fly forward to take the Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front ofthe Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched.
"'Course, Wood's a superb Keeper!" Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint
waited for Madam Hooch's whistle. "Superb! Very difficult to pass --very difficult indeed -- YES! I DON'T BELIEVE IT! HE'S SAVED IT!"
Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still
making sure he caught every word of Lee's commentary. It was essentialthat he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fiftypoints up --258"Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession -- no!
Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell, Katie Bell for
Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she's streaking up the field -- THAT WASDELIBERATE!"
Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead
of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cart wheeled in theair, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle.
Madam Hooch's whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and
began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penaltypast the Slytherin Seeker.
"THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING --""Jordan, if you can't commentate in an unbiased way --""I'm telling it like it is, Professor!"Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch it was
shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts -- but hemustn't catch it yet -- and if Malfoy saw it -
Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Firebolt around
and sped off toward the Slytherin end -- it worked. Malfoy went haringafter him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there....
WHOOSH.One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry's right ear, hit by the
gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again
WHOOSH.The second Bludger grazed Harry's elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was
closing in.
Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him,259clubs raised --
He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick
collided with a sickening crunch.
"Ha haaa!" yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from
each other, clutching their heads. "Too bad, boys! You'll need to get upearlier than that to beat a Firebold And it's Gryffindor in possessionagain, as Johnson takes the Quaffle -- Flint alongside her -- poke himin the eye, Angelina! -- it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke -- ohno -- Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goalposts, come on now, Wood, save --!"
But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin
end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug themagical megaphone away from him.
"Sorry, Professor, sorry! WoiA happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead,
thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession --"
it was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged
that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins wererapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia withhis club and tried to say he'd thought she was a Bludger. George Weasleyelbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teamspenalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making thescore forty-ten to Gryffindor.
The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to
Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it once Gryffindorwas fifty points ahead -
Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around
her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking ofrevenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred's and George's absenceto aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one afterthe other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom,completely winded.
Madam Hooch was beside herself260"YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN
THE SCORINGAREA!" she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. "Gryffindor penalty!"
And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a
Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle Out of his hands; Aliciaseized it and put it through the Slytherin goal -- seventy-ten.
The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse -- Gryffindor was
sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cupwas theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as hesoared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoyspeeding along behind him.
And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him.Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he
stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down --
Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed
hold of the Firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back.
"You --"Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn't reach -- Malfoy was
panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes weresparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he'd wanted to do -- theSnitch had disappeared again.
"Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I've never seen such tactics." Madam
Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto hisNimbus Two Thousand and One.
"YOU CHEATING SCUM!" Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone,
dancingout of Professor McGonagall's reach. "YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B --"
Pprofessor McGonagall didn't even bother to tell him off She was
actually shaking her finger in Malfoys direction, her hat had fallen261off, and she too was shouting furiously.
Alicia took Gryffindor's penalty, but she was so angry she missed by
several feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and theSlytherins, delighted by Malfoy's foul on Harry, were being spurred onto greater heights.
"Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal -- Montague scores
--" Lee groaned. "Seventy- twenty to Gryffindor..."
Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each
other. Harry wasn't going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch....
"Get out of it, Potter!" Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to
turn and found Harry blocking him.
"Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina,
COME ON!"
Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was
streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper-- they were all going to block her --
Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along
the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward theSlytherins.
"AAAAAAARRRGH!"They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina's Way was
clear.
"SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty Points to twenty!"Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt
in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.
And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was
diving, a look of triumph on his face -- there, a few feet above thegrass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer -262Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead -
"Go! Go! Go!" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfay -- Harry
flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him --he was at Malfoy's ankles -- he was level --
Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked
Malfoy's arm out of the way and --
"YES!"He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium
exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. Thetiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wingshopelessly against his fingers.
Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized
Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harryfelt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina's,Alicia's, and Katie's voices, "We've won the Cup! We've won the Cup!"Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yellinghoarsely, back to earth.
Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto
the field. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confusedimpression of noise and bodies pressing in on him. Then he, and the restof the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust intothe light, he saw Hagrid, Plastered with crimson rosettes -- "Yeh beat'em, Harry, yeh beat 'em!
Wait till I tell Buckbeak!" There was Percy, jumping up and down like a
maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing hardereven than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; andthere, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Wordsfailed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands,where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.
If only there had been a dementor around.... As a sobbing Wood passed
Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have263produced the world's best Patronus.
CHAPTER 16
Harry's euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a
week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, thedays became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing wasstrolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with severalpints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstonesor watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface ofthe lake.
But they couldn't. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing
around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle,trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts ofsummer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasleyhad been spotted working; they were about to take their O.W.L.s(Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take hisN.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the highestqualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry ofMagic, he needed top grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gavevery severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the commonroom in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxiousthan Percy was Hermione.
Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend
several classes at once, but they couldn't restrain themselves when theysaw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first columnread:
Monday9 o'clock, Arithmancy9 o'clock, TransfigurationLunch2641 o'clock, Charms
1 o'clock, Ancient Runes"Hermione?" Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when
interrupted these days. "Er -- are you sure you've copied down thesetimes right?"
"What?" snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it.
"Yes, of course I have."
"Is there any point asking how you're going to sit for two exams at
once?" said Harry.
"No," said Hermione shortly. "Have either of you seen my copy of
Numerology and Gramatica?"
"Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading," said Ron, but
very quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment Harry, Ron,and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid.
"Beaky's gettin' a bit depressed," Hagrid told them, bending low on the
pretense of checking that Harry's flobberworm was still alive. "Bincooped up too long. But still... we'll know day after tomorrow -- oneway or the other --"
They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try
as Harry might, he couldn't get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, andSnape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbledsomething that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes beforemoving away.
Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of
Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything FloreanFortescue had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing hecould have had one of Fortescue's choco-nut sundaes with him in thestifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in thegreenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room oncemore, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day,when it would all be over.265Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the
Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any ofthem had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, wherethey had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow,cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across apatch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk,then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart.
"Excellent, Harry," Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk,
grinning. "Full marks."
Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione.
Ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, which successfullyconfused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione dideverything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it.After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.
"Hermione!" said Lupin, startled. "What's the matter?""P -- P -- Professor McGonagall!" Hermione gasped, pointing into the
trunk. "Sh -- she said I'd failed everything!"
It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had
regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle.Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione's boggart, but anargument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.
Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing
there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry.
"Hello there, Harry!" he said. "Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly
finished?"
"Yes," said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with
the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.
"Lovely day," said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake."Pity... pity..."266He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.
"I'm here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of amad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Blacksituation, I was asked to step in."
"Does that mean the appeal's already happened?" Ron interrupted,
stepping forward.
"No, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon," said Fudge, looking
curiously at Ron.
"Then you might not have to witness an execution at A!" said Eon
stoutly. "The hippogriff might get off!"
Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors
behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before theirvery eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache.Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for theDisposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squintedtoward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, "Dear, dear, I'mgetting too old for this.... Two o'clock, isn't it, Fudge?"
The black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry
looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of ashining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudgedhim hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall.
"Why'd you stop me?" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for
lunch. "Did you see them? They've even got the axe ready! This isn'tjustice!"
"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can't go saying things like
that to his boss!" said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. "Aslong as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly,they can't possibly execute Buckbeak...."
But Harry could tell Hermione didn't really believe what she was saying.267All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch,
happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry,Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn't joinin.
Harry's and Ron's last exam was Divination; Hermione's, Muggle Studies.
They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on thefirst floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh,where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase toProfessor Trelawney's classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minutestudying.
"She's seeing us all separately," Neville informed them as they went to
sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open onhis lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. "Have either of you everseen anything in a crystal ball?" he asked them unhappily.
"Nope," said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry.
knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started.
The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each
person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the classhissed, "What did she ask? Was it okay?"
But they all refused to say."She says the crystal ball's told her that if I tell you, I'll have a
horrible accident!" squeaked Neville as he clambered back down theladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing.
"That's convenient," snorted Ron. "You know, I'm starting to think
Hermione was right about her" -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdooroverhead -- "she's a right old fraud."
"Yeah," said Harry, looking at his own watch. It-was now two o'clock.
"Wish she'd hurry up..."
Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride."She says I've got all the makings of a true Seer," she informed Harry268and Ron. "I saw loads of stuff... Well, good luck!"
She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender."Ronald Weasley," said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads.
Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harrywas now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on thefloor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in thesunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.
Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron's large feet reappeared on the
ladder.
"How'd it go?" Harry asked him, standing up."Rubbish," said Ron. "Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up.
Don't think she was convinced, though...."
"Meet you in the common room," Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney's
voice called, "Harry Potter!"
The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed,
the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as hestumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where ProfessorTrelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.
"Good day, my dear," she said softly. "If you would kindly gaze into the
Orb.... Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it...."
Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could,
willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, butnothing happened.
"Well?" Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. "What do you see?"The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the
perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ronhad just said, and decided to pretend.
"Er --" said Harry, "a dark shape... um..."269"What does it resemble?" whispered Professor Trelawney. "Think, now..."
Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak."A hippogriff," he said firmly."Indeed!" whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the
parchment perched upon her knees. "My boy, you may well be seeing theoutcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Lookcloser... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?"
"Yes," said Harry firmly."Are you sure?" Professor Trelawney urged him. "Are you quite sure,
dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowyfigure raising an axe behind it?"
"No!" said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick."No blood? No weeping Hagrid?""No!" said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the
heat. "It looks fine, it's - - flying away..."
Professor Trelawney sighed."Well, dear, I think we'll leave it there.... A little disappointing...
but I'm sure you did your best."
Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a
loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.
"IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT."Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her
armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging.
"S -- sorry?" said Harry.270But Professor Trelawney didn't seem to hear him. Her eyes started to
roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she was about tohave some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to thehospital wing -- and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the sameharsh voice, quite unlike her own:
"THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY
HIS FOLLOWERS.HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT,BEFOREMIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TOREJOIN HISMASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANTSAID, GREATER ANDMORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS. TONIGHT... BEFOREMIDNIGHT... THESERVANT... WILL SET OU... TO REJOIN... HIS MASTER....
Professor Trelawney's head fell forward onto her chest. She made a
grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quitesuddenly, Professor Trelawney's head snapped up again.
"I'm so sorry, dear boy," she said dreamily, "the heat of the day, you
know... I drifted off for a moment...."
Harry sat there, staring at her."Is there anything wrong, my dear?""You -- you just told me that the -- the Dark Lord's going to rise
again... that his servant's going to go back to him.
Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled."The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that's hardly
something to joke about.... Rise again, indeed --"
,'But you just said it! You. said the Dark Lord --""I think you must have dozed off too, dear!" said Professor Trelawney.271"I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched
as that!"
Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase,
wondering... had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a realprediction? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test?
Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the
entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney's words stillresounding in his head. People were striding past him in the oppositedirection, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit oflong-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole andentered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner,however, sat Ron and Hermione.
"Professor Trelawney," Harry panted, "just told me --"But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces."Buckbeak lost," said Ron weakly. "Hagrid's just sent this."Hagrid's note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his
hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardlylegible.
Lost appeal. They're going to execute at sunset. Nothing you can do.
Don't come down. I don't want you to see it.
Hagrid"We've got to go," said Harry at once. "He can't just sit there on his
own, waiting for the executioner!"
"Sunset, though," said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed
sort of way. "We'd never be allowed... 'specially you, Harry...."
Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking."If we only had the Invisibility Cloak...."272"Where is it?" said Hermione.
Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed
witch.
"... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I'm in serious
trouble," he finished.
"That's true," said Hermione, getting to her feet. "If he sees you....
How do you open the witch's hump again?"
"You -- you tap it and say, 'Dissendium,'" said Harry. "But --"Hermione didn't wait for the rest of his sentence; she strode across the
room, pushed open the Fat Lady's portrait and vanished from sight.
"She hasn't gone to get it?" Ron said, staring after her.She had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery
cloak folded carefully under her robes.
"Hermione, I don't know what's gotten, into you lately!" said Ron,
astounded. "First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on ProfessorTrelawney --"
Hermione looked rather flattered.They went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to
Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down tie front ofhis robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump. They skulkedin an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they weresure it was deserted. They heard a last pair of people hurrying acrossthe hall and a door slamming. Hermione poked her head around the door.
"Okay," she whispered, "no one there -- cloak on --"Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed
the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone frontsteps into the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the ForbiddenForest, gilding the top branches of the trees.273They reached Hagrid's cabin and knocked. He was a minute in answering,
and when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, pale-faced andtrembling.
"It's us," Harry hissed. "We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us
in and we can take it off."
"Yeh shouldn've come!" Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they
stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off thecloak.
Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks. He
looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. Thishelplessness was worse to watch than tears.
"Wan' some tea?" he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for
the kettle.
"Where's Buckbeak, Hagrid?" said Hermione hesitantly.I -- I took him outside," said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table
as he filled up the jug. "He's tethered in me pumpkin patch. Thought heoughta see the trees an' -- an' smell fresh air -- before
Hagrid's hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his
grasp and shattered all over the floor.
"I'll do it, Hagrid," said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting
to clean up the mess.
"There's another one in the cupboard," Hagrid said, sitting down and
wiping his forehead on his sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked backhopelessly.
"Isn't there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?" Harry asked fiercely,
sitting down next to him. "Dumbledore --"
"He's tried," said Hagrid. "He's got no power ter overrule the
Committee. He told 'em Buckbeak's all right, but they're scared.... Yeh274know what Lucius Malfoy's like... threatened 'em, I expect... an' the
executioner, Macnair, he's an old pal o' Malfoy's... but it'll be quickan' clean... an' I'll be beside him.... "
Hagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though
looking for some shred of hope or comfort.
"Dumbledore's gonna come down while it -- while it happens. Wrote me
this mornin'. Said he wants ter -- ter be with me. Great man,Dumbledore...."
Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid's cupboard for another milk
jug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She straightened up with thenew jug in her hands, fighting back tears.
"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid," she began, but Hagrid shook his
shaggy head.
"Yeh're ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don' wan' yeh
watchin'. An' yeh shouldn' be down here anyway... If Fudge an'Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh'll be in bigtrouble."
Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione's face, but she hid them
from Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she picked up the milkbottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek.
"Ron, I don't believe it -- it's Scabbers!"Ron gaped at her."What are you talking about?"Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside
down. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside,Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table.
"Scabbers!" said Ron blankly. "Scabbers, what are you doing here?"He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers275looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had
fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron's hands asthough desperate to free himself
"It's okay, Scabbers!" said Ron. "No cats! There's nothing here to hurt
you!"
Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally
ruddy face had gone the color of parchment.
"They're comin'...."Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking down
the distant castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his silverbeard gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted Cornelius Fudge.Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner,Macnair.
"Yeh gotta go," said Hagrid. Every inch of him was trembling. "They
mustn' find yeh here.... Go now..."
Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak.
"I'll let yeh out the back way," said Hagrid.
They followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt strangely
unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tetheredto a tree behind Hagrid's Pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to knowsomething was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side andpawed the ground nervously.
"It's okay, Beaky," said Hagrid softly. "It's okay..." He turned to
Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "Go on," he said. "Get goin'."
But they didn't move."Hagrid, we can't --""We'll tell them what really happened --""They can't kill him --"276"Go!" said Hagrid fiercely. "It's bad enough without you lot in trouble
an' all!"
They had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, they
heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place wherethey had just vanished from sight.
"Go quick," he said hoarsely. "Don' listen...."And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door.Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off
silently around Hagrid's house. As they reached the other side, thefront door closed with a sharp snap.
"Please, let's hurry," Hermione whispered. "I can't stand it, I can't
bear it...."
They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking
fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to thewest there was a ruby-red glow.
Ron stopped dead."Oh, please, Ron," Hermione began."It's Scabbers -- he won't -- stay put --"Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat
was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying tosink his teeth into Ron's hand.
"Scabbers, it's me, you idiot, it's Ron," Ron hissed.They heard a door open behind them and men's voices."Oh, Ron, please let's move, they're going to do it!" Hermione breathed."Okay -- Scabbers, stay put --"277They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to listen to
the rumble of voices behind them. Ron stopped again.
"I can't hold him -- Scabbers, shut up, everyone'll hear us --"The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the
sounds drifting from Hagrid's garden. There was a jumble of indistinctmale voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakableswish and thud of an axe.
Hermione swayed on the spot."They did it!" she whispered to Harry. "I d -- don't believe it -- they
did it!"
CHAPTER 17
Harry's mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood
transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last raysof the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long- shadowedgrounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.
"Hagrid," Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he
made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms.
"We can't," said Ron, who was paper-white. "He'll be in worse trouble if
they know we've been to see him...."
Hermione's breathing was shallow and uneven."How -- could -- they?" she choked. "How could they?""Come on," said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering.They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves
hidden under the cloak. The light was fading fast now.278By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell
around them.
"Scabbers, keep still," Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest.
The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to forceScabbers deeper into his pocket. "What's the matter with you, You stupidrat? Stay still -- OUCH! He bit me!"
"Ron, be quiet!" Hermione whispered urgently. "Fudge'll be out here in a
minute --"
"He won't -- stay -- put --"Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might,
trying to break free of Ron's grip.
"What's the matter with him?"But Harry had just seen -- stinking toward them, his body low to the
ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness -- Crookshanks.Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers'ssqueaks, Harry couldn't tell.
"Crookshanks!" Hermione moaned. "No, go away, Crookshanks! Go away!"But the cat was getting nearer --"Scabbers -- NO!"Too late -- the rat had slipped between Ron's clutching fingers, hit the
ground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him,and before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ron had thrown theInvisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.
"Ron!" Hermione moaned.She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it ""as
impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and itstreamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they couldhear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.279"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --"
There was a loud thud."Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --"Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in
front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back inhis pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.
"Ron -- come on back under the cloak --" Hermione panted. "Dumbledore
the Minister -- they'll be coming back out in a minute --"
But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even
catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws....Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow -- an enormous,pale-eyed, jet-black dog.
Harry reached for his wand, but too late -- the dog had made an enormous
leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward ina whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch- long teeth -
But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him.
Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up;he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.
Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry
aside; the dog's jaws fastened instead around Ron's outstretched arm.Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute's hair, but itwas dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll --
Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was
knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and falltoo.
Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes"Lumos!"he whispered.280The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased
Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches werecreaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stopthem going nearer.
And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward
into a large gap in the roots -- Ron was fighting furiously, but hishead and torso were slipping out of sight --
"Ron!" Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped
lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.
All they could see now was one of Ron's legs, which he had hooked around
a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground-- but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron's leg hadbroken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight.
"Harry -- we've got to go for help --" Hermione gasped; she was bleeding
too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder.
"No! That thing's big enough to eat him; we haven't got time --""Harry -- we're never going to get through without help --"Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles."If that dog can get in, we can," Harry panted, darting here and there,
trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but hecouldn't get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range ofthe tree's blows.
"Oh, help, help," Hermione whispered frantically, dancing U._ certainly
on the spot, "Please..."
Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches
like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.
Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped
moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.281"Crookshanks!" Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry's
arm painfully hard. "How did he know --?"
"He's friends with that dog," said Harry grimly. "I've seen them
together. Come on -- and keep your wand out --"
They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had
reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flickof his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward, headfirst,and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel.Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light fromHarry's wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him.
"Where's Ron?" she whispered in a terrified voice."This way," said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks."Where does this tunnel come out?" Hermione asked breathlessly from
behind him.
"I don't know... It's marked on the Marauder's Map but Fred and George
said no one's ever gotten into it.... It goes off the edge of the map,but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade..."
They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them,
Crookshanks's tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went thepassage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes.... All Harrycould think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing tohim.... He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at acrouch....
And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and
Crookshanks had gone. instead, Harry could see a patch of dim lightthrough a small opening.
He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised
their wands to see what lay beyond.
It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the
walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture282was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all
boarded up.
Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was
deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowyhallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry's arm again. Her wide eyes weretraveling around the boarded windows.
"Harry," she whispered, "I think we're in the Shrieking Shack."Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large
chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped offentirely.
"Ghosts didn't do that," he said slowly.At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had Moved
upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione's grip onHarry's arm was so tight he was losing feeling in-his fingers. He raisedhis eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.
Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and UP the crumbling
staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except thefloor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something beingdragged upstairs.
They reached the dark landing."Nox," they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands
went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they heardmovement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. Theyexchanged a last look, a last nod.
Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks,
purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutchinghis leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.283Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.
"Ron -- are you okay?""Where's the dog?""Not a dog," Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. "Harry, it's
a trap --"
"What --""He's the dog... he's an Animagus."Ron was staring over Harry's shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a
snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.
A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn't been
shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. Thewaxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it lookedlike a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was SiriusBlack.
"Expelliarmus!"he croaked, pointing Ron's wand at them.Harry's and Hermione's wands shot out of their hands, high in the air,
and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixedon Harry.
"I thought you'd come and help your friend," he said hoarsely.His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using
it. "Your father would have done the same for me. Brave of you) not torun for a teacher. I'm grateful... it will make everything mucheasier...."
The taunt about his father rang in Harry's ears as though Black had
bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry's chest, leaving no placefor fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in hishand, not to defend himself, but to attack... to kill. Without knowing284what he was doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden movement
on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held himback.... "No, Harry!" Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron,however, spoke to Black.
"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!" he said
fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him ofstill more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.
Something flickered in Black's shadowed eyes."Lie down," he said quietly to Ron. "You will damage that leg even
more."
"Did you hear me?" Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to
Harry to stay upright. "You'll have to kill all three of us!"
"There'll be only one murder here tonight," said Brack, and his grin
widened.
"Why's that?" Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron, and
Hermione. "Didn't care last time, did you? Didn't mind slaughtering allthose Muggles to get at Pettigrew... What's the matter, gone soft inAzkaban?"
"Harry!" Hermione whimpered. "Be quiet!""HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!" Harry roared, and with a huge effort he
broke free of Hermione's and Ron's restraint and lunged forward -
He had forgotten about magic -- he had forgotten that he was short and
skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man -- allHarry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could andthat he didn't care how much he got hurt in return --
Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black
didn't raise the wands in time -- one of Harry's hands fastened over hiswasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry's otherhand collided with the side of Black's head and they fell, backward,into the wall -285Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as
the wands in Black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missedHarry's face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingerstwisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part ofBlack it could find.
But Black's free hand had found Harry's throat"No," he hissed, "I've waited too long --"The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.Then he saw Hermione's foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry
with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black's wand hand andHarry heard a faint clatter --
He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling
across the floor; he threw himself toward it but
"Argh!"Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk
themselves deep into Harry's arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanksnow darted toward Harry's wand --
"NO YOU DON'T!" roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that
made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned-
"Get out of the way!" he shouted at Ron and Hermione.They didn't need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip
bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron's wands. Ron crawledto the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face nowtinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.
Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and
fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wandpointing straight at Black's heart.286"Going to kill me, Harry?" he whispered.
Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black's chest,
looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black's left eyeand his nose was bleeding.
"You killed my parents," said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his
wand hand quite steady.
Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes."I don't deny it," he said very quietly. "But if you knew the whole
story."
"The whole story?" Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. "You
sold them to Voldemort. That's all I need to know."
"You've got to listen to me," Black said, and there was a note of
urgency in his voice now. "You'll regret it if you don't.... You don'tunderstand...."
"I understand a lot better than you think," said Harry, and his voice
shook more than ever. "You never heard her, did you? My mum... trying tostop Voldemort killing me... and you did that... you did it...."
Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked
past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black's chest and settled himselfthere, right over Black's heart. Black blinked and looked down at thecat.
"Get off," he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him.But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black's robes and wouldn't shift. He
turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with thosegreat yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.
Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the
wand. So what if he had to kill the cat too? It was in league withBlack.... If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that287wasn't Harry's business.... If Black wanted to save it, that only proved
he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry's parents....
Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment
to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had tokill Black. This was his chance....
The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised,
Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron's raggedbreathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.
And then came a new sound -Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor -- someone was
moving downstairs.
"WE'RE UP HERE!" Hermione screamed suddenly. "WE'RE UP HERE --
SIRIUSBLACK - QUICK!"
Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Harry
gripped his wand convulsively -- Do it now! said a voice in his head --but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn'tdone it.
The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry
wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his facebloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lyingon the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry,standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself,crumpled and bleeding at Harry's feet.
"Expelliarmus!" Lupin shouted.Harry's wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was
holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staringat Black, who still had Crookshanks lying Protectively across his chest.
Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn't done it. His nerve
had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the dementors.288Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.
"Where is he, Sirius?"Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn't understannd what Lupin meant.
Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again.
Black's face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn't move
at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straightat Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.
"But then..." Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he
was trying to read his mind, "... why hasn't he shown himself beforenow? Unless" -- Lupin's eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeingsomething beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, "-- unlesshe was the one... unless you switched... without telling me?"
Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin's face, Black nodded."Professor," Harry interrupted loudly, "what's going on --?"But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice
die in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixed at Black.The Professor walked to Black's side, seized his hand, pulled him to hisfeet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like abrother.
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach."DON'T BELIEVE IT!" Hermione screamed.Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the
floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. "You -- you --"
"Hermione --""-- you and him!""Hermione, calm down --"289"I didn't tell anyone!" Hermione shrieked. "I've been covering up for
you --"
"Hermione, listen to me, please'" Lupin shouted. "I can explain --"Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave
of fury.
"I trusted you," he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of
control, "and all the time you've been his friend!"
"You're wrong," said Lupin. "I haven't been Sirius's friend, but I am
now -- Let me explain...."
"NO!" Hermione screamed. "Harry, don't trust him, he's been helping
Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too -- he's a werewolf!"
There was a ringing silence. Everyone's eyes were now on Lupin, who
looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.
"Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione," he said. "Only one out
of three, I'm afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castleand I certainly don't want Harry dead. An odd shiver passed over hisface. "But I won't deny that I am a werewolf."
Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper
of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, "Getaway ftom me, werewolf!"
Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione
and said, "How long have you known?"
"Ages," Hermione whispered. "Since I did Professor Snape's essay...""He'll be delighted," said Lupin coolly. "He assigned that essay hoping
someone would realize what my symptoms meant.... Did you check the lunarchart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did yourealize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?"290"Both," Hermione said quietly.
Lupin forced a laugh."You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.""I'm not," Hermione whispered. "If I'd been a bit cleverer, I'd have
told everyone what you are!"
"But they already know," said Lupin. "At least, the staff do.""Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf. Ron gasped. "Is
he mad?"
"Some of the staff thought so," said Lupin. "He had to work very hard to
convince certain teachers that I'm trustworthy --"
"AND HE WAS WRONG!" Harry yelled. "YOUVE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL
THE TIME!"He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bedand sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leaptup beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away fromboth of them, dragging his leg.
I have not been helping Sirius," said Lupin. "If you'll give me a
chance, I'll explain. Look --"
He separated Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's wands and threw each back to
its owner; Harry caught his, stunned.
There, said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt "You're
armed, we're not. Now will you listen?"
Harry didn't know what to think. Was it a trick?"If you haven't been helping him," he said, with a furious glance at
Black, "how did you know he was here?"
"The map," said Lupin. "The Marauder's Map. I was in my office examining
it --"291"You know how to work it?" Harry said suspiciously.
"Of course I know how to work it," said Lupin, waving his hand
impatiently. "I helped write it. I'm Moony -- that was my friends'nickname for me at school."
"You wrote --?""The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening,
because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneakout of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed.And I was right, wasn't I"
He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of
dust rose at his feet.
"You might have been wearing your father's old cloak, Harry--""How d'you know about the cloak?""The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...," said Lupin,
waving an impatient hand again. "The point is, even if you're wearing anInvisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder's Map. I watchedyou cross the grounds and enter Hagrid's hut. Twenty minutes later, youleft Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were nowaccompanied by somebody else."
"What?" said Harry. "No, we weren't!"I couldn't believe my eyes," said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring
Harry's interruption. "I thought the map must be malfunctioning. Howcould he be with you?" "No one was with us!" said Harry.
"And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius
Black.... I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of youinto the Whomping Willow --"
"One of us!" Ron said angrily.292"No, Ron," said Lupin. "Two of you."
He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron."Do you think I could have a look at the rat?" he said evenly."What?" said Ron. "What's Scabbers got to do with it?""Everything," said Lupin. "Could I see him, please?"Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged,
thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop himescaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black's leg and made a soft hissingnoise.
Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he
gazed intently at Scabbers.
"What?" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared.
"What's my rat got to do with anything?"
"That's not a rat," croaked Sirius Black suddenly."What d'you mean -- of course he's a rat --""No, he's not," said Lupin quietly. "He's a wizard.""An Animagus," said Black, "by the name of Peter Pettigrew."
CHAPTER 18
It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in.
Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.
"You're both mental.""Ridiculous!" said Hermione faintly.293"Peter Pettigrew's dead!" said Harry. "He killed him twelve years ago!"
He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.
"I meant to," he growled, his yellow teeth bared, "but little Peter got
the better of me... not this time, though!"
And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron
yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg.
."Sirius, NO!" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging
Black away from Ron again, "WAIT! You can't do it just like that -- theyneed to understand -- we've got to explain --"
"We can explain afterwards!" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off.
One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, whowas squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he triedto escape.
"They've -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything!" Lupin
panted, still trying to restrain Black. "Ron's kept him as a pet! Thereare parts of it even I don't understand, and Harry -- you owe Harry thetruth, Sirius!"
Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on
Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, adbleeding hands.
"All right, then," Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat."Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit
the murder I was imprisoned for..."
"You're nutters, both of you," said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry
and Hermione for support. "I've had enough of this. I'm off."
He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand
again, pointing it at Scabbers.
"You're going to hear me out, Ron," he said quietly. "Just keep a tight
hold on Peter while you listen."294"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back
into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed andoverbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed.Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.
There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die," he said. "A whole street
full of them..."
"They didn't see what they thought they saw!" said Black savagely, still
watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands.
"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter," said Lupin, nodding. "I believed
it myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's mapnever lies... Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry."
Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently:
Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sensewhatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must haveunhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him?
Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as
though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.
"But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be
true, you know it can't..."
"Why can't it be true?" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class,
and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment withgrindylows.
"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an
Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And Ilooked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keepstabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a registershowing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and Iwent and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there havebeen only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on thelist."295Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put
into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.
"Light again, Hermione!" he said. "But the Ministry never knew that here
used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts."
"I you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus," said
Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. "I'vewaited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer."
"All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius," said Lupin, I only
know how it began..."
Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom
door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. ThenLupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.
"No one there...""This place is haunted!" said Ron."It's not," said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. "The
Shrieking Shack was never haunted.... The screams and howls thevillagers used to hear were made by me."
He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment then
said, "That's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf,None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitter... and if Ihadn't been so foolhardy..."
He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said,
"Shh!" She was watching Lupin very intently.
"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried
everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion thatProfessor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. Itmakes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding thefull moon, I keep my mind when I transform.... I'm able to curl up in myoffice, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.296"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully
fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be ableto come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their childrenexposed to me.
"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said
that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason Ishouldn't come to school...." Lupin sighed, and looked directly atHarry. "I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted theyear I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I cameto Hogwarts. This house" -- Lupin looked miserably around the room, --"the tunnel that leads to it -- they were built for my use. Once amonth, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform.The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across mewhile I was dangerous."
Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he was listening
raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin's voice wasScabbers's frightened squeaking.
"My transformations in those days were -- were terrible. It is very
painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, soI bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise andthe screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violentspirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor.... Even now, when the househas been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it...."
"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been
in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends.Sirius Black... Peter Pettigrew... and, of course, your father, Harry --James Potter."
"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared
once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother wasill, and that I had to go home to see her... I was terrified they woulddesert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they,like you, Hermione, worked out the truth...."
"And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me
that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times297of my life. They became Animagi."
"My dad too?" said Harry, astounded."Yes, indeed," said Lupin. "It took them the best part of three years to
work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the clevereststudents in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagustransformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the Ministry keeps aclose watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help hecould get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, theymanaged it. They could each turn into a different animal at will."
"But how did that help you?" said Hermione, sounding puzzled."They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as
animals," said Lupin. "A werewolf is only a danger to people. Theysneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak.They transformed... Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath theWillow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. Theywould then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, Ibecame less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed tobecome less so while I was with them."
"Hurry up, Remus," snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a
horrible sort of hunger on his face.
"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there... well, highly exciting
possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon wewere leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and thevillage by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals,they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwartsstudents ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeadethan we did.... And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, andsign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. Jameswas Prongs."
"What sort of animal --?" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off."That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a
werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?"298"A thought that still haunts me," said Lupin heavily. "And there were
near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We wereyoung, thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness."
I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course...
he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have doneso, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for myown and others' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow studentsinto becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget myguilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month'sadventure. And I haven't changed..."
Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. "All
this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I shouldtell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why?Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'dbetrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led othersalong with me... and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. Helet me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have beenshunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what Iam. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the schoolusing dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus hadnothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me allalong."
"Snape?" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first
time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. "What's Snape got to do withit?"
"He's here, Sirius," said Lupin heavily. "He's teaching here as well."
He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my
appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has beentelling Dumbledore A year that I am not to be trusted. He has hisreasons... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearlykilled him, a trick which involved me --"
Black made a derisive noise.299"It served him right," he sneered. "Sneaking around, trying to find out
what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled...."
"Severus was very interested in where I went every month." Lupin told
Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "We were in the same year, you know, and we --er -- didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James.Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field... anywaySnape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening asshe led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought itwould be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod theknot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get inafter me. Well, of course, Snape tried it -- if he'd got as far as thishouse, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father, who'dheard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, atgreat risk to his life... Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of thetunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from thattime on he knew what I was...."
"So that's why Snape doesn't like you," said Harry slowly, "because he
thought you were in on the joke?"
"That's right," sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin.Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing,
directly at Lupin.
CHAPTER 19
Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he'd
received a huge electric shock.
"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow," said Snape, throwing
the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin'schest. "Very useful, Potter, I thank you...."
Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed
triumph. "You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?" he said,300his eyes glittering. "I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot
to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very luckyI did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. Oneglance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along thispassageway and out of sight."
"Severus --" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him."I've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your old
friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here's the proof. Not even Idreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout--"
"Severus, you're making a mistake," said Lupin urgently. "You haven't
heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry--"
"Two more for Azkaban tonight," said Snape, his eyes now gleaming
fanatically. "I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this....He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tamewerewolf --"
"You fool," said Lupin softly. "Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an
innocent man back inside Azkaban?"
BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and
twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles; heoverbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage,Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight betweenBlack's eyes.
"Give me a reason," he whispered. "Give me a reason to do it, and I
swear I will."
Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face
showed more hatred.
Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe.
He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as hedid, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione,301however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very
breathless voice, "Professor Snape -- it it wouldn't hurt to hear whatthey've got to say, w -- would it?"
"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,"
Snape spat. "You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the companyof a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold yourtongue."
"But if -- if there was a mistake --""KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite
deranged. "DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!" Afew sparksshot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black'sface. Hermione fell silent.
"Vengeance is very sweet," Snape breathed at Black. "How I hoped I would
be the one to catch you...."
"The joke's on you again, Severus," Black snarled. "As long as this boy
brings his rat up to the castle" -- he jerked his head at Ron -- "I'llcome quietly...."
"Up to the castle?" said Snape silkily. "I don't think we need to go
that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of theWillow. They'll be very pleased to see you, Black... pleased enough togive you a little kiss, I daresay... I --"
What little color there was in Blacks face left it."You -you've got to hear me out," he croaked. "The rat -- look at the
rat --"
But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen
before. He seemed beyond reason.
"Come on, all of you," he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of
the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. "I'll drag the werewolf.Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too --"302Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three
strides and blocked the door.
"Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already," snarled
Snape. "If I hadn't been here to save your skin --"
"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,"
Harry said. "I've been alone with him loads of times, having defenselessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't hejust finish me off then?"
"Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works," hissed Snape.
"Get out of the way, Potter."
"YOURE PATHETIC!" Harry yelled. "JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL
OF YOU ATSCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN --"
"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!" Snape shrieked,
lookingmadder than ever. "Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved yourneck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been wellserved if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, tooarrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of theway, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!"
Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even
one step toward him, he had raised his wand.
"Expelliarmus!" he yelled -- except that his wasn't the only voice that
shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges;Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid downit to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He hadbeen knocked out.
Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at
exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed onthe bed next to Crookshanks.303"You shouldn't have done that," said Black, looking at Harry.
"You should have left him to me...."Harry avoided Black's eyes. He wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done the
right thing.
"We attacked a teacher... We attacked a teacher..." Hermione whimpered,
staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. "Oh, we're going tobe in so much trouble --"
Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and
untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes hadcut into them.
"Thank you, Harry," he said."I'm still not saying I believe you," he told Lupin."Then it's time we offered you some proof," said Lupin. "You, boy --
give me Peter, please. Now."
Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest."Come off it," he said weakly. "Are you trying to say he broke out of
Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean..." He looked up atHarry and Hermione for support, "Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into arat -- there are millions of rats -- how's he supposed to know which onehe's after if he was locked up in Azkaban?"
"You know, Sirius, that's a fair question," said Lupin, turning to Black
and frowning slightly. "How did you find out where he was?"
Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a
crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show theothers.
It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the
Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron's shoulder, wasScabbers.304"How did you get this?" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.
"Fudge," said Black. "When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave
me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page on this boy'sshoulder... I knew him at once... how many times had I seen himtransform? And the caption said the boy would be going back toHogwarts... to where Harry was...
"My God," said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the
paper and back again. "His front paw..."
"What about it?" said Ron defiantly."He's got a toe missing," said Black."Of course," Lupin breathed. "So simple... so brilliant... he cut it off
himself?"
"Just before he transformed," said Black. "When I cornered him, he
yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James.Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wandbehind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- andsped down into the sewer with the other rats...."
"Didn't you ever hear, Ron?" said Lupin. "The biggest bit of Peter they
found was his finger."
"Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He's
been in my family for ages, right --"
"Twelve years, in fact," said Lupin. "Didn't you ever wonder why he was
living so long?"
"We -- we've been taking good care of him!" said Ron."Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?" said Lupin. "I'd
guess he's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on theloose again...."305"He's been scared of that mad cat!" said Ron, nodding toward
Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed.
But that wasn't right, Harry thought suddenly... Scabbers had been
looking ill before he met Crookshanks... ever since Ron's return fromEgypt... since the time when Black had escaped....
"This cat isn't mad," said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand
and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head. "He's the most intelligent of hiskind I've ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. Andwhen he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trustedme.... Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, andhe's been helping me. .. "What do you mean?" breathed Hermione.
"He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn't... so he stole the
passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me.... As I understand it, he tookthem from a boy's bedside table...."
Harry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was
hearing. It was absurd... and yet...
"But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it." croaked Black.
"This cat -- Crookshanks, did you call him? -- told me Peter had leftblood on the sheets.... I supposed he bit himself... Well, faking hisown death had worked once."
These words jolted Harry to his senses."And why did he fake his death?" he said furiously. "Because he knew you
were about to kill him like you killed my parents!"
"No," said Lupin, "Harry-""And now you've come to finish him off!""Yes, I have," said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers."Then I should've let Snape take you!" Harry shouted."Harry," said Lupin hurriedly, "don't you see? All this time we've306thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down -- but
it was the other way around, don't you see? Peter betrayed your motherand father -- Sirius tracked Peter down --"
"THAT'S NOT TRUE!" Harry yelled. "HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE
SAID SOBEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!"
He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes
were suddenly over bright.
"Harry... I as good as killed them," he croaked. "I persuaded Lily and
James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use himas Secret-Keeper instead of me.... I'm to blame, I know it.... The nightthey died, I'd arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe,but when I arrived at his hiding place, he'd gone. Yet there was no signof a struggle. It didn't feel right. I was scared. I set out for yourparents' house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, andtheir bodies... I realized what Peter must've done... what I'd done...."
His voice broke. He turned away."Enough of this," said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice
Harry had never heard before. "There's one certain way to prove whatreally happened. Ron, give me that rat."
"What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?" Ron asked
Lupin tensely.
"Force him to show himself," said Lupin. "If he really is a rat, it
won't hurt him."
Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took
him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning,his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. "Ready, Sirius?" said Lupin.
Black had already retrieved Snape's wand from the bed. He approached
Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to beburning in his face.307"Together?" he said quietly.
"I think so,,, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his
wand in the other. "On the count of three. One -- two -- THREE!"
A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment,
Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly -- Ronyelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blindingflash of light and then --
It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was
shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, aman was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing hishands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on hisback was standing up.
He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His
thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch ontop. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot ofweight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers'sfur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and hisvery small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathingfast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again.
"Well, hello, Peter," said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently
erupted into old school friends around him. "Long time, no see.
"S -- Sirius... R -- Remus..." Even Pettigrew's voice was squeaky.
Again, his eyes darted toward the door. "My friends... my oldfriends..."
Black's wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a
warning took, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light andcasual.
"We've been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night
Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while youwere squeaking around down there on the bed --"
"Remus," gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking308out over his pasty face, "you don't believe him, do you...? He tried to
kill me, Remus...."
"So we've heard," said Lupin, more coldly. "I'd like to clear up one or
two little matters with you, Peter, if you'll be so --"
"He's come to try and kill me again!" Pettigrew squeaked suddenly,
pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, becausehis index was missing. "He killed Lily and James and now he's going tokill me too.... You've got to help me, Remus...."
Black's face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew
with his fathomless eyes.
"No one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few things
out," said Lupin.
"Sorted things out?" squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once
more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again' the only door. "Iknew he'd come after me! I knew he'd be back for me! I've been waitingfor this for twelve years!"
"You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?" said Lupin, his
brow furrowed. "When nobody has ever done it before?"
"He's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!" Pettigrew
shouted shrilly. "How else did he get out of there? I supposeHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!"
Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the
whole room.
"Voldemort, teach me tricks?" he said.Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him."What, scared to hear your old master's name?" said Black. I don't blame
you, Peter. His lot aren't very happy with you, are they?"
"Don't know what you mean, Sirius --" muttered Pettigrew, his breathing309faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now.
"You haven't been hiding from me for twelve years," said Black. "You've
been hiding from Voldemort's old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban,Peter... They all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them....I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Soundslike they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort wentto the Potters' on your information... and Voldemort met his downfallthere. And not all Voldemort's supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they?There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they'veseen the error of their ways.
If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter --""Don't know... what you're talking about...," said Pettigrew again, more
shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up atLupin. "You don't believe this -- this madness, Remus --"
"I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent
man would want to spend twelve years as a rat," said Lupin evenly.
"Innocent, but scared!" squealed Pettigrew. "If Voldemort's supporters
were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban --the spy, Sirius Black!"
Black's face contorted."How dare you," he growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he
had been. I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around peoplewho were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter -- I'llnever understand why I didn't see you were the spy from the start. Youalways liked big friends who'd look after you, didn't you? It used to beus... me and Remus... and James....
Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath."Me, a spy... must be out of your mind... never... don't know how you
can say such a --"
"Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,"310Black hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward. "I
thought it was the perfect plan... a bluff... Voldemort would be sure tocome after me, would never dream they'd use a weak, talentless thinglike you.... It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life,telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters."
Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like
"far-fetched" and "lunacy," but he couldn't help paying more attentionto the ashen color of Pettigrew's face and the way his eyes continued todart toward the windows and door.
"Professor Lupin?" said Hermione timidly. "Can -- can I say something?""Certainly, Hermione," said Lupin courteously."Well -- Scabbers -- I mean, this -- this man -- he's been sleeping in
Harry's dormitory for three years. If he's working for You-Know-Who, howcome he never tried to hurt Harry before now?"
"There!" said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed hand.
"Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry's head!Why should I?"
"I'll tell you why," said Black. "Because you never did anything for
anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort's been inhiding for fifteen years, they say he's half dead. You weren't about tocommit murder right under Albus Dumbledore's nose, for a wreck of awizard who'd lost all of his power, were you? You'd want to be quitesure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back tohim, wouldn't you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in?Keeping an ear out for news, weren't YOU, Peter? Just in case your oldprotector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him...."
Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to
have lost the ability to talk.
"Er -- Mr. Black -- Sirius?" said Hermione.Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as
though he had never seen anything quite like her.311"If you don't mind me asking, how -- how did you get out of Azkaban, if
you didn't use Dark Magic?"
"Thank you!" gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. "Exactly!
Precisely what I --"
But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly at
Hermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He seemed to bepondering his answer.
"I don't know how I did it," he said slowly. "I think the only reason I
never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn't a happythought, so the dementors couldn't suck it out of me... but it kept mesane and knowing who I am... helped me keep my powers... so when it allbecame ... too much... I could transform in my cell... become a dog.Dementors can't see, you know...." He swallowed. "They feel their waytoward people by feeding off their emotions.... They could tell that myfeelings were less -- less human, less complex when I was a dog... butthey thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else inthere, so it didn't trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I hadno hope of driving them away from me without a wand...."
"But then I saw Peter in that picture... I realized he was at Hogwarts
with Harry... perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his earsthat the Dark Side was gathering strength again...."
Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all
the while at Black as though hypnotized.
"... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies... and to
deliver the last Potter to them. if he gave them Harry, who'd dare sayhe'd betrayed Lord Voldemort? He'd be welcomed back with honors....
"So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter
was still alive...."
Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Wealsey. "The guards say
he's been talking in his sleep... always the same words... 'He's atHogwarts.'"312"It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head, and the dementors
couldn't destroy it.... It wasn't a happy feeling... it was anobsession... but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one nightwhen they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog....It's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they wereconfused.... I was thin, very thin... thin enough to slip through thebars.... I swam as a dog back to the mainland.... I journeyed north andslipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I've been living in theforest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course.You fly as well as your father did, Harry...."
He looked at Harry, who did not look away."Believe me," croaked Black. "Believe me, Harry. I never betrayed James
and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them."
And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he
nodded.
"No!"Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry's nod had been his own
death sentence. He shuffled forward on his knees, groveling, his handsclasped in front of him as though praying.
"Sirius -- it's me... it's Peter... your friend... you wouldn't --"Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled."There's enough filth on my robes without you touching them," said
Black.
"Remus!" Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing
imploringly in front of him. "You don't believe this wouldn't Siriushave told you they'd changed the plan?"
"Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter," said Lupin. "I assume that's
why you didn't tell me, Sirius?" he said casually over Pettigrews head.313"Forgive me, Remus," said Black.
"Not at all, Padfoot, old friend," said Lupin, who was now rolling up
his sleeves. "And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you werethe spy?"
"Of course," said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his
gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. "Shall we kill himtogether?"
"Yes, I think so," said Lupin grimly."You wouldn't... you won't...," gasped Pettigrew. And he scrambled
around to Ron.
"Ron... haven't I been a good friend... a good pet? You won't let them
kill me, Ron, will you... you're on my side, aren't you.
But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion."I let you sleep in my bed!" he said."Kind boy... kind master..." Pettigrew crawled toward Ron "You won't let
them do it.... I was your rat.... I was a good pet...."
"If you made a better rat than a human, it's not much to boast about,
Peter," said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenchedhis broken leg out of Pettigrew's reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees,staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione's robes.
"Sweet girl... clever girl... you -- you won't let them.... Help me...."Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew's clutching hands and backed
away against the wall, looking horrified.
Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and-turned his head slowly
toward Harry.
"Harry... Harry... you look just like your father... just like him...."314"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?" roared Black. "HOW DARE YOU
FACE HIM? HOWDARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?"
"Harry," whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched.
"Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed.... James would haveunderstood, Harry... he would have shown me mercy..."
Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew's shoulders, and
threw him backward onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror,staring up at them.
"You sold Lily and James to Voldemort," said Black, who was shaking too.
"Do you deny it?"
Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized,
balding baby, cowering on the floor.
"Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord... you have no
idea... he has weapons you can't imagine.... I was scared, Sirius, I wasnever brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen....He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me --"
"DON'T LIE!" bellowed Black. "YOU'D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO
HIM FORA YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!"
"He -- he was taking over everywhere!" gasped Pettigrew. "Wh -- what was
there to be gained by refusing him?"
"What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has
ever existed?" said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. "Onlyinnocent lives, Peter!"
"You don't understand!" whined Pettigrew. "He would have killed me,
Sirius!"
"THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!" roared Black. "DIED RATHER THAN
BETRAY YOURFRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!"315Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised.
"You should have realized," said Lupin quietly, "if Voldemort didn't
kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter."
Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall."NO!" Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front Pettigrew,
facing the wands. "You can't kill him," he said breathlessly. "Youcan't."
Black and Lupin both looked staggered."Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents," Black
snarled. "This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too,without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant moreto him than your whole family."
"I know," Harry panted. "We'll take him up to the castle. We'll hand him
over to the dementors.... He can go to Azkaban... but don't kill him."
"Harry!" gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry's knees.
"You -- thank you -- it's more than I deserve -- thank you --"
"Get off me," Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew's hands off him in disgust.
"I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it because -- I don't reckon mydad would've wanted them to become killers -- just for you."
No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming
in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking ateach other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands.
"You're the only person who has the right to decide, Harry," said Black.
"But think... think what he did...."
"He can go to Azkaban," Harry repeated. "If anyone deserves that place,
he does...."
Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him.316"Very well," said Lupin. "Stand aside, Harry."
Harry hesitated."I'm going to tie him up," said Lupin. "That's all, I swear."Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin's wand this
time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound andgagged.
"But if you transform, Peter," growled Black, his own wand pointing at
Pettigrew too, "we will kill you. You agree, Harry?"
Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that
Pettigrew could see him.
"Right," said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. "Ron, I can't mend bones
nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it's best if we just strapyour leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing."
He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron's leg with his wand, and
muttered, "Ferula." Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly toa splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly onthe leg and didn't wince.
"That's better," he said. "Thanks.""What about Professor Snape?" said Hermione in a small voice, looking
down at Snape's prone figure.
"There's nothing seriously wrong with him," said Lupin, bending over
Snape and checking his pulse. "You were just a little --overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er -- perhaps it will be best if wedon't revive him until we're safety back in the castle. We can take himlike this...."
He muttered, "Mobilicorpus." As though invisible strings were tied to
Snape's wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position,head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung a few317inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the
Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket.
"And two of us should be chained to this," said Black, nudging Pettigrew
with his toe. "Just to make sure."
"I'll do it," said Lupin."And me," said Ron savagely, limping forward.Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright
again, left arm chained to Lupin's right, right arm to Ron's left. Ron'sface was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers's true identity as apersonal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the wayout of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high.
CHAPTER 20
Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way
down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking likeentrants in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, driftingcreepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held upby his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry andHermione brought up the rear.
Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron
had to turn sideways to manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew coveredwith his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel insingle file. Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right afterBlack, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he keptbumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impressionBlack was making no effort to prevent this.
"You know what this means?" Black said abruptly to Harry as they made
their slow progress along the tunnel. "Turning Pettigrew in?"
"You' re free," said Harry.318"Yes...," said Black. "But I'm also -- I don't know if anyone ever told
you -- I'm your godfather."
"Yeah, I knew that," said Harry."Well... your parents appointed me your guardian," said Black stiffly.
"If anything happened to them..."
Harry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he meant?"I'll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and
uncle," said Black. "But... well... think about it. Once my name'scleared... if you wanted a... a different home..."
Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry's stomach."What -- live with you?" he said, accidentally cracking his head on a
bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. "Leave the Dursleys?"
"Of course, I thought you wouldn't want to," said Black quickly. "I
understand, I just thought I'd --"
"Are you insane?" said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Black's."Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can
I move in?"
Black turned right around to look at him; Snape's head was scraping the
ceiling but Black didn't seem to care.
"You want to?" he said. "You mean it?""Yeah, I mean it!" said Harry.Black's gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon
it. The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten yearsyounger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he wasrecognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry's parents' wedding.
They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel.319Crookshanks darted up first; he had evidently pressed his paw to the
knot on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered upwardwithout any sound of savaging branches.
Black saw Snape up through the hole, then stood back for Harry and
Hermione to pass. At last, all of them were out.
The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant
windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew was stillwheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry's mind was buzzing. He wasgoing to leave the Dursleys. He was going to live with Sirius Black, hisparents' best friend.... He felt dazed.... What would happen when hetold the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they'd seen ontelevision... !
"One wrong move, Peter," said Lupin threateningly ahead. His wand was
still pointed sideways at Pettigrew's chest.
Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing
slowly larger. Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black, his chinbumping on his chest. And then -
A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their
party was bathed in moonlight.
Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who had stopped abruptly.
Black froze. He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop.
Harry could see Lupin's silhouette. He had gone rigid. Then his limbs
began to shake.
"Oh, my --" Hermione gasped. "He didn't take his potion tonight! He's
not safe!"
"Run," Black whispered. "Run. Now."But Harry couldn't run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He leapt
forward but Black caught him around the chest and threw him back.
"Leave it to me -- RUN!"320There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin's head was lengthening. So
was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly onhis face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks'shair was on end again; he was backing away --
As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared from
Harry's side. He had transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog boundedforward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it,the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward, away from Ronand Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other.
Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to
notice anything else. It was Hermione's scream that alerted him --
Pettigrew had dived for Lupin's dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his
bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light -- and Ron laymotionless on the ground. Another bang -- Crookshanks flew into the airand back to the earth in a heap.
"Expelliarmus." Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew;
Lupin's wand flew high into the air and out of sight. "Stay where youare!" Harry shouted, running forward.
Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip
through the manacle on Ron's outstretched arm and heard a scurryingthrough the grass.
There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf
taking flight; it was galloping into the forest --
"Sirius, he's gone, Pettigrew transformed!" Harry yelled.Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at
Harry's words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of hispaws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds.
Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron."What did he do to him?" Hermione whispered. Ron's eyes were only321half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could
hear him breathing, but he didn't seem to recognize them.
"I don't know...."Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone... they had
no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair.
"We'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone," said Harry,
pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. "Come --"
But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, a
whining: a dog in pain....
"Sirius," Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.He had a moment's indecision, but there was nothing they could do for
Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble --
Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed to
be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake. They pelted towardit, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing what itmust mean -
The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, they saw
why -- Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours,his hands over his head.
'Nooo," he moaned. 'Nooo... please...."And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding
in a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, thefamiliar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure hisvision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they wereencircling them....
"Herrnione, think of something happy!" Harry yelled, raising his wand,
blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to ridit of the faint screaming that had started inside it --322I'm going to live with my godfather. I'm leaving the Dursleys.
He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant:
"Expecto patronum! Expecto patronum!"
Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground,
pale as death.
He'll be all right. I'm going to go and live with him."Expecto patronum! Hermione, help me! Expecto patronum!""Expecto --" Hermione whispered, "expecto -- expecto --"But she couldn't do it. The dementors were closing in, barely ten feet
from them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and weregetting closer....
"EXPECTO PATRONUM!" Harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from his
ears. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!"
A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him.
At the same moment, Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him. He wasalone... completely alone....
"Expecto -- expecto patronum --"Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes. With
a huge effort, he fought to remember -- Sirius was innocent -- innocent-- We'll be okay -- I' mgoing to live with him --
"Ex ecto patronum!" he gasped.By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, He saw a dementor halt,
very close to him. It couldn't walk through the cloud of silver mistHarry had conjured. A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. Itmade a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside.
"No -- no --" Harry gasped. "He's innocent... expecto expecto patronum
--"323He could feet them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil
wind around him. The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him. Thenit raised both its rotting hands -- and lowered its hood.
Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed
skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth... agaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a deathrattle.
A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn't move or speak. His
Patronus flickered and died.
White fog was blinding him. He had to fight... expecto patronum ... he
couldn't see... and in the distance, he heard the familiar screaming...expecto patronum... he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found hisarm... they weren't going to take him....
But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around
Harry's neck. They were forcing his face upward.... He could feel itsbreath.... It was going to get rid of him first.... He could feel itsputrid breath.... His mother was screaming in his ears.... She was goingto be the last thing he ever heard --
And then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a
silvery light growing brighter and brighter... He felt himself fallforward onto the grass.... Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking,Harry opened his eyes. The dementor must have released him. The blindinglight was illuminating the grass around him.... The screaming hadstopped, the cold was ebbing away...
Something was driving the dementors back.... It was circling around him
and Black and Hermione.... They were leaving....
The air was warm again....With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head a
few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across thelake.... Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what itwas.... It was as bright as a unicorn.... Fighting to stay conscious,324Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore. For
a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back...raising his hand to pat it... someone who looked strangely familiar ...but it couldn't be...
Harry didn't understand. He couldn't think anymore. He felt the last of
his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted.
CHAPTER 21
Shocking business... shocking... miracle none of them died... never
heard the like... by thunder, it was lucky you were there, Snape...."
"Thank you, Minister.""Order of Merlin, Second Class, I'd say. First Class, if I can wangle
it!"
"Thank you very much indeed, Minister.""Nasty cut you've got there.... Black's work, I suppose?""As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and Granger, Minister....""No!""Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm, to
judge by their behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility hewas innocent. They weren't responsible for their actions. On the otherhand, their interference might have permitted Black to escape.... Theyobviously thought they were going to catch Black single-handed. They'vegot away with a great deal before now... I'm afraid it's given them arather high opinion of themselves... and of course Potter has alwaysbeen allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster --"
"Ah, well, Snape... Harry Potter, you know... we've all got a bit of a
blind spot where he's concerned."325"And yet -- is it good for him to be given so much special treatment?
Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any otherstudent would be suspended -- at the very least -- for leading hisfriends into such danger. Consider, Minister -- against all school rules-- after all the precautions put in place for his protection --out-of-bounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer --and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegallytoo --"
"Well, well... we shall see, Snape, we shall see.... The boy has
undoubtedly been foolish...."
Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt very groggy. The
words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears tohis brain, so that it was difficult to understand.... His limbs feltlike lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift.... He wanted to lie here, onthis comfortable bed, forever....
"What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors... you've really
no idea what made them retreat, Snape?"
"No, Minister... by the time I had come 'round they were heading back to
their positions at the entrances...."
"Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl --""All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black,
naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back tothe castle."
There was a pause. Harry's brain seemed to be moving a little faster,
and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach....
He opened his eyes.Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his glasses. He
was lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, hecould make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a bed.Harry squinted. Ron's red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey's arm.326Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed to his right lay
Hermione. Moonlight was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open too.She looked petrified, and when she saw that Harry was awake, pressed afinger to her lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door. It was ajar,and the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it fromthe corridor outside.
Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry's bed.
He turned to took at her. She was carrying the largest block ofchocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder.
"Ah, you're awake!" she said briskly. She placed the chocolate on
Harry's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer.
"How's Ron?" said Harry and Hermione together."He'll live, said Madam Pomfrey grimly. "As for you two you'll be
staying here until I'm satisfied you're -- Potter, what do you thinkyou're doing?"
Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up his
wand.
"I need to see the headmaster," he said."Potter," said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, "it's all right. They've got
Black. He's locked away upstairs. The dementors will be performing thekiss any moment now --"
"WHAT?"Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his shout
had been heard in the corridor outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge andSnape had entered the ward.
"Harry, Harry, what's this?" said Fudge, looking agitated. "You should
be in bed -- has he had any chocolate?" he asked Madam Pomfreyanxiously.
"Minister, listen!" Harry said. "Sirius Black's innocent! Peter327Pettigrew faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can't let the
dementors do that thing to Sirius, he's --"
But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face."Harry, Harry, you're very confused, you've been through a dreadful
ordeal, lie back down, now, we've got everything under control...."
"YOU HAVEN'T!" Harry yelled. "YOUVE GOT THE WRONG MAN!""Minister, listen, please," Hermione said; she had hurried to Harry's
side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge's face. "I saw him too. Itwas Ron's rat, he's an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and --"
"You see, Minister?" said Snape. "Confunded, both of them.... Black's
done a very good job on them...." "WE'RE NOT CONFUNDED!" Harry roared.
"Minister! Professor!" said Madam Pomfrey angrily. "I must insist that
you leave. Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!"
"I'm not distressed, I'm trying to tell them what happened!" Harry said
furiously. "If they'd just listen --"
But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into
Harry's mouth; he choked, and she seized the opportunity to force himback onto the bed.
"Now, please, Minister, these children need care. Please leaveThe door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry swallowed his mouthful
of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again.
"Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black --""For heaven's sake!" said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. "Is this a
hospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist --"
"My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss
Granger," said Dumbledore calmly. "I have just been talking to SiriusBlack --"328"I suppose he's told you the same fairy tale he's planted in Potter's
mind?" spat Snape. "Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive --"
"That, indeed, is Black's story," said Dumbledore, surveying Snape
closely through his half-moon spectacles.
"And does my evidence count for nothing?" snarled Snape. "Peter
Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of himon the grounds."
"That was because you were knocked out, Professor!" said Hermione
earnestly. "You didn't arrive in time to hear
"Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!""Now, Snape," said Fudge, startled, "the young lady is disturbed in her
mind, we must make allowances --"
"I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone," said Dumbledore
abruptly. "Cornelius, Severus, Poppy -- please leave us."
"Headmaster!" sputtered Madam Pomfrey. "They need treatment, they need
rest --"
"This cannot wait," said Dumbledore. "I must insist."Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end
of the ward, slamming the door behind her. Fudge consulted the largegold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat.
"The dementors should have arrived by now," he said. "I'll go and meet
them. Dumbledore, I'll see you upstairs."
He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn't
moved.
"You surely don't believe a word of Black's story?" Snape whispered, his
eyes fixed on Dumbledore's face.329"I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone," Dumbledore repeated.
Snape took a step toward Dumbledore."Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen," he
breathed. "You haven't forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven't forgottenthat he once tried to kill me?"
"My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus," said Dumbledore quietly.Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still
holding. It closed behind them, and Dumbledore turned to Harry andHermione. They both burst into speech at the same time.
"Professor, Black's telling the truth -- we saw Pettigrew "-- he escaped
when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf --"
"-- he's a rat --""-- Pettigrew's front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off --""-- Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn't Sirius --"But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations."It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because
there is very little time," he said quietly. "There is not a shred ofproof to support Black's story, except your word -- and the word of twothirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full ofeyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gaveevidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters'Secret-Keeper."
"Professor Lupin can tell you --" Harry said, unable to stop himself"Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone
anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Siriuswill be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrustedby most of our kind that his support will count for very little -- andthe fact that he and Sirius are old friends --"330"But --"
"Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see
that Professor Snape's version of events is far more convincing thanyours."
"He hates Sirius," Hermione said desperately. "All because of some
stupid trick Sirius played on him --"
"Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady
-- entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife -- without Pettigrew, alive ordead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius's sentence."
"But you believe us.""Yes, I do," said Dumbledore quietly. "But I have no power to make other
men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of Magic...."
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground
beneath him were falling sharply away. He had grown used to the ideathat Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pullsome amazing solution out of the air. But no ... their last hope wasgone.
"What we need," said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved
from Harry to Hermione, "is more time."
"But --" Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. "OH!""Now, pay attention," said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very
clearly. "Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick's office on the seventhfloor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goeswell, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. Butremember this, both of you: you must not be seen. Miss Granger, you knowthe law -- you know what is at stake.... You -- must -- not -- be --seen."
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his
heel and looked back as he reached the door.331"I am going to lock you in. It is --" he consulted his watch, "five
minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck."
"Good luck?" Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore. "Three
turns? What's he talking about? What are we supposed to do?"
But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes, pulling from
beneath them a very long, very fine gold chain.
"Harry, come here," she said urgently. "Quick!"Harry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She was holding the chain
out. He saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it.
"Here --"She had thrown the chain around his neck too."Ready?" she said breathlessly."What are we doing?" Harry said, completely lost.Hermione turned the hourglass over three times.The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he was flying very
fast, backward. A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him, his earswere pounding, he tried to yell but couldn't hear his own voice --
And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came into
focus again --
He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a
stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from theopen front doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of thehourglass cutting into his neck.
"Hermione, what --?""In here!" Hermione seized Harry's arm and dragged him across the hall332to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed him inside among
the buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them.
"What -- how -- Hermione, what happened?""We've gone back in time," Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off
Harry's neck in the darkness. "Three hours back..."
Harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a lot,
which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a verybizarre dream.
"But --""Shh! Listen! Someone's coming! I think -- I think it might be us!"
Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door.
"Footsteps across the hall... yes, I think it's us going down to
Hagrid's!"
"Are you telling me," Harry whispered, "that we're here in this cupboard
and we're out there too?"
"Yes," said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. "I'm
sure it's us. It doesn't sound like more than three people... and we'rewalking slowly because we're under the Invisibility Cloak -- "
She broke off, still listening intently."We've gone down the front steps...."Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious,
but Harry wanted a few questions answered.
"Where did you get that hourglass thing?""It's called a Time-Turner," Hermione whispered, "and I got it from
Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I've been using it all yearto get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn'ttell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of333Magic so I could have one. She had to tell them that I was a model
student, and that I'd never, ever use it for anything except mystudies.... I've been turning it back so I could do hours over again,that's how I've been doing several lessons at once, see? But...
"Harry, I don't understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he
tell us to go back three hours? How's that going to help Sirius?"
Harry stared at her shadowy face."There must be something that happened around now he wants us to
change," he said slowly. "What happened? We were walking down toHagrid's three hours ago...."
"This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid's," said
Hermione. "We just heard ourselves leaving...."
Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in
concentration.
"Dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent
life...." And then it hit him. "Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!"
"But -- how will that help Sirius?""Dumbledore said -- he just told us where the window is -- the window of
Flitwick's office! Where they've got Sirius locked up! We've got to flyBuckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape onBuckbeak -- they can escape together!"
From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she looked terrified."If we manage that without being seen, it'll be a miracle!""Well, we've got to try, haven't we?" said Harry. He stood up and
pressed his ear against the door. "Doesn't sound like anyone's there....Come on, let's go."
Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall was deserted. As
quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and334down the stone steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of
the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold.
"If anyone's looking out of the window --" Hermione squeaked, looking up
at the castle behind them.
"We'll run for it," said Harry determinedly. "Straight into the forest,
all right? We'll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep alookout --"
"Okay, but we'll go around by the greenhouses!" said Hermione
breathlessly. "We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid's front door, orwe'll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid's by now!"
Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione
behind him. They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses,paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could,skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of theforest....
Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later,
Hermione arrived beside him, panting.
"Right," she gasped. "We need to sneak over to Hagrid's.... Keep out of
sight, Harry...."
They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge
of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid's house, theyheard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunkand peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway,shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harryheard his own voice.
"It's us. We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can
take it off."
"Yeh shouldn've come!" Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the
door quickly.
"This is the weirdest thing we've ever done," Harry said fervently.335"Let's move along a bit," Hermione whispered. "We need to get nearer to
Buckbeak!"
They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff,
tethered to the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin patch.
"Now?" Harry whispered."No!" said Hermione. "If we steal him now, those Committee people will
think Hagrid set him free! We've got to wait until they've seen he'stied outside!"
"That's going to give us about sixty seconds," said Harry. This was
starting to seem impossible.
At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid's
cabin.
"That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug," Hermione whispered. "I'm going to
find Scabbers in a moment --"
Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione's shriek of
surprise.
"Hermione," said Harry suddenly, "what if we -- we just run in there and
grab Pettigrew --"
"No!" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. "Don't you understand? We're
breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed tochange time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen --"
"We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!""Harry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into
Hagrid's house?" said Hermione.
"I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad," said Harry, "or I'd think there was
some Dark Magic going on --"336"Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't
you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happenedwhen wizards have meddled with time.... Loads of them ended up killingtheir past or future selves by mistake!"
"Okay!" said Harry. "It was just an idea, I just thoughtBut Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his
head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors.Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executionerwere coming down the steps.
"We're about to come out!" Hermione breathed.And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid's back door opened, and Harry saw
himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was,without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behindthe tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.
"It's Okay, Beaky, it's okay..." Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned
to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "Go on. Get goin'."
"Hagrid, we can't --""We'll tell them what really happened"They can't kill him --""Go! It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!"Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility
Cloak over him and Ron.
"Go quick. Don' listen...."There was a knock on Hagrid's front door. The execution party had
arrived. Hagrid turned, around and headed back into his cabin, leavingthe back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches allaround the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, andHermione had gone... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees337could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back
door.
"Where is the beast?" came the cold voice of Macnair."Out -- outside," Hagrid croaked.Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair's face appeared at
Hagrid's window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.
"We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid.
I'll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair,You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure --"
Macnair's face vanished from the window. It was now or never."Wait here," Harry whispered to Hermione. "I'll do it."As Fudge's voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree,
vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.
"It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous
Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown --"
Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes
once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood upagain. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to thefence.
"... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the
Committee's appointed executioner, Walden Macnai..."
"Come on, Buckbeak," Harry murmured, "come on, we're going to help you.
Quietly... quietly..."
"... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here..."Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his
front feet.338"Well, let's get this over with," said the reedy voice of the Committee
member from inside Hagrid's cabin. "Hagrid, perhaps it will be better ifyou stay inside --"
"No, I -- I wan' ter be with him.... I don' wan' him ter be alone --"Footsteps echoed from within the cabin."Buckbeak, move!" Harry hissed.Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak's neck. The hippogriff
began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feetaway from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid's back door. "One moment,please, Macnair," came Dumbledore's voice. "You need to sign too." Thefootsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beakand walked a little faster.
Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree."Harry, hurry!" she mouthed.Harry could still hear Dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin.
He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot.They had reached the trees....
"Quick! Quick!" Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree,
seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster.Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; theycouldn't see Hagrid's garden at all.
"Stop!" he whispered to Hermione. "They might hear usHagrid's back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak
stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
Silence... then --"Where is it?" said the reedy voice of the Committee member. "Where is
the beast?"339"It was tied here!" said the executioner furiously. I saw it! just
here!"
"How extraordinary," said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in
his voice.
"Beaky!" said Hagrid huskily.There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner
seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came thehowling, and this time they could hear Hagrid's words through his sobs.
"Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he's gone! Musta pulled himself
free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!"
Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to
Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels intothe forest floor to stop him.
"Someone untied him!" the executioner was snarling. "We should search
the grounds, the forest."
"Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the
thief will have led him away on foot?" said Dumbledore, still soundingamused. "Search the skies, if you will.... Hagrid, I could do with a cupof tea. Or a large brandy."
"O' -- o' course, Professor," said Hagrid, who sounded weak with
happiness. "Come in, come in...."
Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft
cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence oncemore.
"Now what?" whispered Harry, looking around."We'll have to hide in here," said Hermione, who looked very shaken. "We
need to wait until they've gone back to the castle. Then we wait untilit's safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius's window. He won't be there for340another couple of hours.... Oh, this is going to be difficult...."
She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest.
The sun was setting now.
"We're going to have to move," said Harry, thinking hard. "We've got to
be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won't know what's going on."
"Okay," said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak's rope. "But
we've got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember...."
They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly
around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees throughwhich they could make out the Willow.
"There's Ron!" said Harry suddenly.A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through
the still night air.
"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --"And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry
watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.
"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --""There's Sirius!" said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out
from the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seizeRon....
"Looks even worse from here, doesn't it?" said Harry, watching the dog
pulling Ron into the roots. "Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by thetree -- and so did you -- this is weird--"
The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower
branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying toreach the trunk. And then the tree froze.
"That was Crookshanks pressing the knot," said Hermione.341"And there we go..." Harry muttered. "We're in."
The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds
later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge,and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle.
"Right after we'd gone down into the passage!" said Hermione. "If only
Dumbledore had come with us..."
"Macnair and Fudge would've come too," said Harry bitterly. "I bet you
anything Fudge would've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot...."
They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from
view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then --
"Here comes Lupin!" said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down
the stone steps and hating toward the Willow. Harry looked up at thesky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely.
They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the
knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too,disappeared into the gap in its roots.
"If he'd only grabbed the cloak," said Harry. "It's just lying
there...."
He turned to Hermione."If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape'd never be able to get
it and --"
"Harry, we mustn't be seen!""How can you stand this?" he asked Hermione fiercely. "Just standing
here and watching it happen?" He hesitated. "I'm going to grab thecloak!"
"Harry, no!"342Hermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon. just
then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up tothe castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as hewalked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands.
"See?" Hermione whispered. "See what would have happened? We've got to
keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!"
The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry
seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watchedHagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stoppedfighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.
Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and
Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.
Harry's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the
tree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up.
"Get your filthy hands off it," Harry snarled under his breath. "Shh!"Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the
knot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak.
"So that's it," said Hermione quietly. "We're all down there... and now
we've just got to wait until we come back up again...."
She took the end of Buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around the
nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees.
"Harry, there's something I don't understand.... Why didn't the
dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passedout... there were so many of them...."
Harry sat down too. He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest
dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something hadcome galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat.
Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished.343"But what was it?"
"There's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,"
said Harry. "A real Patronus. A powerful one."
"But who conjured it?"Harry didn't say anything. He was thinking back to the person he'd seen
on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been... buthow could it have been?
"Didn't you see what they looked like?" said Hermione eagerly. "Was it
one of the teachers?"
"No," said Harry. "He wasn't a teacher.""But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those
dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't itlight him up? Couldn't you see --?"
"Yeah, I saw him," said Harry slowly. "But... maybe I imagined it.... I
wasn't thinking straight.... I passed out right afterward...."
"Who did you think it was?"I think --" Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to
sound. I think it was my dad."
Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now.
She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity.
"Harry, your dad's -- well -- dead," she said quietly."I know that," said Harry quickly."You think you saw his ghost?""I don't know... no... he looked solid....""But then --"344"Maybe I was seeing things," said Harry. "But... from what I could
see... it looked like him.... I've got photos of him...."
Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity.I know it sounds crazy," said Harry flatly. He turned to took at
Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searchingfor worms. But he wasn't really watching Buckbeak.
He was thinking about his father and about his father's three oldest
friends... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.... Had all four of thembeen out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this eveningwhen everyone had thought he was dead.... Was it so impossible hisfather had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the take? Thefigure had been too far away to see distinctly... yet he had felt sure,for a moment, before he'd lost consciousness....
The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in
and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her faceturned toward the Willow, waiting.
And then, at last, after over an hour..."Here we come!" Hermione whispered.She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw
Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in theroots. Then came Hermione... then the unconscious Snape, driftingweirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk towardthe castle.
Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky.
Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon....
"Harry," Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was
thinking, "we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing wecan do...."
"So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again.. said Harry345quietly.
"How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?" snapped Hermione.
"There's nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we're notsupposed to be doing anything else!"
"All right!"The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures
across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement --
"There goes Lupin," Hermione whispered. "He's transforming"Hermione!" said Harry suddenly. "We've got to move!""We mustn't, I keep telling you --""Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us!"Hermione gasped."Quick!" she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. "Quick! Where are we
going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be comingany moment --"
"Back to Hagrid's!" Harry said. "It's empty now -- come on!"They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them.
They could hear the werewolf howling behind them....
The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and
Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in afterthem and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.
"Shh, Fang, it's us!" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his
ears to quieten him. "That was really close!" she said to Harry.
"Yeah..."Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was346going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back
inside Hagrid's house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded hiswings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.
"I think I'd better go outside again, you know," said Harry slowly. "I
can't see what's going on -- we won't know when it's time --"
Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious."I'm not going to try and interfere," said Harry quickly. "But if we
don't see what's going on, how're we going to know when it's time torescue Sirius?"
"Well... okay, then... I'll wait here with Buckbeak... but Harry, be
careful -- there's a werewolf out there -- and the dementors
Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear
yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in onSirius.... He and Hermione would be running to him any moment....
Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in
his chest.... Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at anymoment....
For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid's
door. You must not be seen. But he didn't want to be seen. He wanted todo the seeing.... He had to know...
And there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness
from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake.... They weremoving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank.... He wouldn'thave to get near them....
Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father...
If it was him... if it really was him... he had to know, had to findout....
The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody.
On the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver -- his ownattempts at a Patronus --347There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself
behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank,the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrifiedexcitement shot through him -- any moment now --
"Come on!" he muttered, staring about. "Where are you? Dad, come on --"But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of
dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It wastime for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help thistime --
And then it hit him -- he understood. He hadn't seen his father -- he
had seen himself --
Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand."EXPECTO PATRONUM! "he yelled.And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but
a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying tosee what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently awayfrom him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its headand charge at the swarming dementors.... Now it was galloping around andaround the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were fallingback, scattering, retreating into the darkness.... They were gone.
The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still
surface of the water. It wasn't a horse. It wasn't a unicorn, either. Itwas a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was comingback to him....
It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it
stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed itsantlered head. And Harry realized... "Prongs, "he whispered.
But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it
vanished.348Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of
his heart, he heard hooves behind him -he whirled around and sawHermione dashing toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her.
"What did you do?" she said fiercely. "You said you were only going to
keep a lookout!"
"I just saved all our lives...," said Harry. "Get behind here -- behind
this bush -- I'll explain."
Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet
again.
"Did anyone see you?""Yes, haven't you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad!
It's okay!"
"Harry, I can't believe it.... You conjured up a Patronus that drove
away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic. I knew Icould do it this time," said Harry, "because I'd already done it....Does that make sense?"
"I don't know -- Harry, look at Snape!"Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had
regained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limpforms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, nodoubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held outin front of him, he moved them away toward the castle.
"Right, it's nearly time," said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch.
"We've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door tothe hospital wing. We've got to rescue Sirius and get back into the wardbefore anybody realizes we're missing.... 11
They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the
bush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, wasferreting for worms again.349"D' you reckon he's up there yet?" said Harry, checking his watch. He
looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right ofthe West Tower.
"Look!" Hermione whispered. "\Who's that? Someone's coming back out of
the castle!"
Harry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the
grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in hisbelt.
"Macnair!" said Harry. "The executioner! He's gone to get the dementors!
This is it, Hermione --"
Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak's back and Harry gave her a leg up.
Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush andclimbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak's rope back over his neckand tied it to the other side of his collar like reins.
"Ready?" he whispered to Hermione. "YotM better hold on to me --He nudged Buckbeak's sides with his heels.Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks
with his knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them.Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could hearher muttering, "Oh, no -- I don't like this oh, I really don't like this--"
Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the upper
floors of the castle.... Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of therope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windowsflashing past --
"Whoa!" he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you
counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as thehippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne.350"He's there!" Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the
window. He reached out, and as Buckbeak's wings fell, was able to tapsharply on the glass.
Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair,
hurried to the window and tried to open it, but it was locked.
"Stand back!" Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still
gripping the back of Harry's robes with her left hand.
"Alohomora!"The window sprang open."How -- how --?" said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff"Get on -- there's not much time," said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly
on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. "You've got to getout of here -the dementors are coming -- Macnair's gone to get them."
Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his
head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. Inseconds, he had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak's back and pullhimself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione.
"Okay, Buckbeak, up!" said Harry, shaking the rope. "Up to the tower --
come on.
The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring
upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with aclatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.
"Sirius, you'd better go, quick," Harry panted. "They'll reach
Flitwick's office any moment, they'll find out you're gone."
Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head."What happened to the other boy? Ron?" croaked Sirius."He's going to be okay. He's still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says351she'll be able to make him better. Quick -- go --"
But Black was still staring down at Harry."How can I ever thank --""GO!" Harry and Hermione shouted together.Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky."We'll see each other again," he said. "You are -- truly your father's
son, Harry...."
He squeezed Buckbeak's sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped
back as the enormous wings rose once more.... The hippogriff took offinto the air.... He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harrygazed after them... then a cloud drifted across the moon.... They weregone.
CHAPTER 22
Harry!"Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her watch. "We've got
exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing withoutanybody seeing us -- before Dumbledore locks the door --"
"Okay," said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, "let's go...."They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly
spiraling stone staircase. As they reached the bottom of it, they heardvoices. They flattened themselves against the wall and listened. Itsounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along thecorridor at the foot of the staircase.
"... only hope Dumbledore's not going to make difficulties," Snape was
saying. "The Kiss will be performed immediately?"352"As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair
has been highly embarrassing. I can't tell you how much I'm lookingforward to informing the Daily Prophet that we've got him at last.... Idaresay they'll want to interview you, Snape... and once young Harry'sback in his right mind, I expect he'll want to tell the Prophet exactlyhow you saved him...."
Harry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape's smirk as he and
Fudge passed Harry and Hermione's hiding place. Their footsteps diedaway. Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they'd reallygone, then started to run in the opposite direction. Down one staircase,then another, along a new ,corridor -- then they heard a cackling ahead.
"Peeves!" Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione's wrist. "In here!"They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. Peeves
seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits,laughing his head off.
"Oh, he's horrible," whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. "I bet
he's all excited because the dementors are going to finish offSirius...." She checked her watch. "Three minutes, Harry!"
They waited until Peeves's gloating voice had faded into the distance,
then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again.
"Hermione -- what'll happen -- if we don't get back inside before
Dumbledore locks the door?" Harry panted.
I don't want to think about it!" Hermione moaned, checking her watch
again. "One minute!"
They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing
entrance. "Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore," said Hermione tensely. "Comeon, Harry!"
They crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore's back
appeared.
"I am going to lock you in," they heard him saying. "it is five minutes353to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do It. Good luck."
Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his
wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran forward.Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silvermustache. "Well?" he said quietly.
"We did it!" said Harry breathlessly. "Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak...."Dumbledore beamed at them."Well done. I think --" He listened intently for any sound within the
hospital wing. "Yes, I think you've gone too -- get inside -- I'll lockyou in --"
Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory. It was empty
except for Ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed. As thelock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their ownbeds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes. A momentlater, Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office.
"Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my
patients now?"
She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept
their chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure theyate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and Hermione were waiting,listening, their nerves jangling.... And then, as they both took afourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roarof fury echoing from somewhere above them....
"What was that?" said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam
Pomfrey was staring at the door.
"Really -- they'll wake everybody up! What do they think they're doing?"Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing
nearer --354"He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the
room with him. When this gets out --"
"HE DIDN'T DISAPPARATE!" Snape roared, now very close at hand. "YOU
CAN'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS -- HAS--SOMETHING -- TO -- DO -- WITH -- POTTER!"
"Severus -- be reasonable -- Harry has been locked up --"BAM.The door of the hospital wing burst open.Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore
alone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoyinghimself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.
"OUT WITH IT, POTTER!" he bellowed. "WHAT DID YOU DO?""Professor Snape!" shrieked Madam Pomfrey. "Control yourself!""See here, Snape, be reasonable," said Fudge. "This door's been locked,
we just saw --"
"THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!" Snape howled, pointing at Harry
andHermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.
"Calm down, man!" Fudge barked. "You're talking nonsense!""YOU DON'T KNOW POTTER!" shrieked Snape. "HE DID IT, I KNOW HE
DID IT--"
"That will do, Severus," said Dumbledore quietly. "Think about what you
are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutesago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?"355"Of course not!" said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. "I would have heard
them!"
"Well, there you have it, Severus," said Dumbledore calmly. "Unless you
are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places atonce, I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further."
Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly
shocked at his behavior, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behindhis glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormedout of the ward.
"Fellow seems quite unbalanced," said Fudge, staring after him. "I'd
watch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore."
"Oh, he's not unbalanced," said Dumbledore quietly. "He's just suffered
a severe disappointment."
"He's not the only one!" puffed Fudge. "The Daily Prophet's going to
have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through ourfingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of thathippogriff's escape to get out, and I'll be a laughingstock! Well... I'dbetter go and notify the Ministry.....
"And the dementors?" said Dumbledore. "They'll be removed from the
school, I trust?"
"Oh yes, they'll have to go," said Fudge, running his fingersdistractedly through his hair. "Never dreamed they'd attempt to
administer the Kiss on an innocent boy... Completely out of control...no, I'll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight.... Perhaps weshould think about dragons at the school entrance...."
"Hagrid would like that," said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and
Hermione. As he and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried tothe door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she headedback to her office.
There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken up.356They could see him sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around.
"What -- what happened?" he groaned. "Harry? Why are we in here? Where's
Sirius? Where's Lupin? What's going on?"
Harry and Hermione looked at each other."You explain," said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate.When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next
day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering, heat andthe end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage ofanother Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going,however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talkingabout the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering whereSirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giantsquid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the threadof the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank. The staghad galloped toward him from there just last night....
A shadow fell across them and they looked 'tip to see a very bleary-eyed
Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth-sizedhandkerchiefs and beaming down at them.
"Know I shouldn' feel happy, after wha' happened las' night," he said.
"I mean, Black escapin' again, an, everythin' -- but guess what?"
"What?" they said, pretending to look curious."Beaky! He escaped! He's free! Bin celebratin' all night!""That's wonderful!" said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because
he looked as though he was close to laughing.
"Yeah... can't've tied him up properly," said Hagrid, gazing happily out
over the grounds. "I was worried this mornin', mind... thought he mightamet Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin'las' night...."
"What?" said Harry quickly.357"Blimey, haven' yeh heard?" said Hagrid, his smile fading a little. He
lowered his voice, even though there was nobody in sight. "Er -- Snapetold all the Slytherins this mornin'.... Thought everyone'd know bynow... Professor Lupin's a werewolf, see. An' he was loose on thegrounds las' night.... He's packin' now, o' course.
"He's packing?" said Harry, alarmed. "Why?""Leavin', isn' he?" said Hagrid, looking surprised that Harry had to
ask. "Resigned firs' thing this mornin'. Says he can't risk it happeninagain.
Harry scrambled to his feet."I'm going to see him," he said to Ron and Hermione."But if he's resigned --""-- doesn't sound like there's anything we can do --""I don't care. I still want to see him. I'll meet you back here."Lupin's office door was open. He had already packed most of his things.
The grindylow's empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase,which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on hisdesk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door.
"I saw you coming," said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the parchment he
had been poring over. It was the Marauder's Map.
"I just saw Hagrid," said Harry. "And he said you'd resigned. It's not
true, is it?"
"I'm afraid it is," said Lupin. He started opening his desk drawers and
taking out the contents.
"Why?" said Harry. "The Ministry of Magic don't think you were helping
Sirius, do they?"358Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.
"No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to
save your lives." He sighed. "That was the final straw for Severus. Ithink the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he -- er --accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast."
"You're not leaving just because of that!" said Harry.Lupin smiled wryly."This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents.... They
will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after lastnight, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you.... That mustnever happen again."
"You're the best Defense Against the Dark Arts- teacher we've ever had!"
said Harry. "Don't go!"
Lupin shook his head and didn't speak. He carried on emptying his
drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument tomake him stay, Lupin said, "From what the headmaster told me thismorning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. if I'm proud ofanything I've done this year, it's how much you've learned.... Tell meabout your Patronus."
"How d'you know about that?" said Harry, distracted."What else could have driven the dementors back?"Harry told Lupin what had happened. When he'd finished, Lupin was
smiling again.
"Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed," he said. "You
guessed right... that's why we called him Prongs."
Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers,
and turned to look at Harry.
"Here -- I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night," he said,359handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak. "And..." He hesitated, then
held out the Marauder's Map too. "I am no longer your teacher, so Idon't feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It's no use to me,and I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it."
Harry took the map and grinned."You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would've wanted to
lure me out of school... you said they'd have thought it was funny."
"And so we would have," said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case.
"I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highlydisappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages outof the castle."
There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder's Map
and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket.
It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn't look surprised to see Harry
there.
"Your carriage is at the gates, Remus," he said."Thank You, Headmaster."Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank."Well -- good-bye, Harry," he said, smiling. "It has been a real
pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage...."
Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as
possible.
"Good-bye, then, Remus," said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin shifted the
grindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands.Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left theoffice.
Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor. He360heard the door close and looked up. Dumbledore was still there.
"Why so miserable, Harry?" he said quietly. "You should be very proud of
yourself after last night."
"It didn't make any difference," said Harry bitterly. "Pettigrew got
away."
"Didn't make any difference?" said Dumbledore quietly, "It made all the
difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You savedan innocent man from a terrible fate."
Terrible. Something stirred in Harry's memory. Greater and more terrible
than ever before... Professor Trelawney's prediction!
"Professor Dumbledore -- yesterday, when I was having my Divination
exam, Professor Trelawney went very -- very strange."
"Indeed?" said Dumbledore. "Er -- stranger than usual, you mean?""Yes... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said ... she
said Voldemort's servant was going to set out to return to him beforemidnight.... She said the servant would help him come back to power."Harry stared up at Dumbledore. "And then she sort of became normalagain, and she couldn't remember anything she'd said. Was it -- was shemaking a real prediction?"
Dumbledore looked mildly impressed."Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been." he said thoughtfully.
"Who'd have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up totwo. I should offer her a pay raise...."
"But --" Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so
calmly?
"But -- I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew!
That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!"
"It does not," said Dumbledore quietly. "Hasn't your experience with the361Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions
are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is avery difficult business indeed.... Professor Trelawney, bless her, isliving proof of that.... You did a very noble thing, in savingPettigrew's life."
"But if he helps Voldemort back to power"Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is
in your debt.... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it createsa certain bond between them... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wantshis servant in the debt of Harry Potter."
"I don't want a connection with Pettigrew!" said Harry. "He betrayed my
parents!"
"This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust
me... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew'slife."
Harry couldn't imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though
he knew what Harry was thinking.
"I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry," he
said gently. "He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it."
Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn't laugh -- he could tell
Dumbledore...
"I thought it was my dad who'd conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw
myself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him." "An easy mistaketo make," said Dumbledore softly. "I expect you'll tire of hearing it,but you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes... youhave your mother's eyes.
Harry shook his head."It was stupid, thinking it was him," he muttered. "I mean, I knew he
was dead."362"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we
don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Yourfather is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when youhave need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus?Prongs rode again last night."
It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said.Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi," said
Dumbledore, smiling. "An extraordinary achievement -- not least, keepingit quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form yourPatronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch matchagainst Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your fatherlast night.... You found him inside yourself."
And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused
thoughts.
Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night
that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron,Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harryheard many different theories about what had really happened, but noneof them came close to the truth.
Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had
found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outragedthat he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. PercyWeasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius's escape.
"If I manage to get into the Ministry, I'll have a lot of proposals to
make about Magical Law Enforcement!" he told the only person who wouldlisten -- his girlfriend, Penelope.
Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was socheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in
helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of aschool year in worse spirits.
He certainly wasn't the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin363go. The whole of Harry's Defense Against the Dark Arts class was
miserable about his resignation.
"Wonder what they'll give us next year?" said Seamus Finnigan gloomily."Maybe a vampire," suggested Dean Thomas hopefully.It wasn't only Professor Lupin's departure that was weighing on Harry's
mind. He couldn't help thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney'sprediction. He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he hadsought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing that was loweringHarry's spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to theDursleys. For maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believedhe would be living with Sirius from now on... his parents' bestfriend.... It would have been the next best thing to having his ownfather back. And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news,because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn'thelp feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had,and the fact that it was now impossible.
The exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione had passed every subject. Harry was amazed that he had gotthrough Potions. He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might havestepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. Snape's behavior towardHarry over the past week had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn't havethought it possible that Snape's dislike for him could increase, but itcertainly had. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape'sthin mouth every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexinghis fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry's throat.
Percy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and George had scraped a
handful of O.W.L.s each. Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks totheir spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had won the Housechampionship for the third year running. This meant that the end of termfeast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that theGryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated.Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys thenext day as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next mornIng,364Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news.
"I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast.
I've decided to drop Muggle Studies."
"But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent!" said
Ron.
"I know," sighed Hermione, "but I can't stand another year like this
one. That Time-Turner, it was driving me mad. I've handed it in. WithoutMuggle Studies and Divination, I'll be able to have a normal scheduleagain."
I still can't believe you didn't tell us about it," said Ron grumpily.
"We're supposed to be your friends."
"I promised I wouldn't tell anyone," said Hermione severely. She looked
around at Harry, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind amountain. Two whole months before he'd see it again....
"Oh, cheer up, Harry!" said Hermione sadly."I'm okay," said Harry quickly. "Just thinking about the holidays.""Yeah, I've been thinking about them too," said Ron. "Harry, you've got
to come and stay with us. I'll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I'llcall you. I know how to use a fellytone now --"
"A telephone, Ron," said Hermione. "Honestly, you should take Muggle
Studies next year...."
Ron *ignored her."It's the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, Harry? Come and
stay, and we'll go and see it! Dad can usually get tickets from work."
This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal."Yeah... I bet the Dursleys'd be pleased to let me come... especially
after what I did to Aunt Marge...."365Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron and Hermione in
several games of Exploding Snap, and when the witch with the tea cartarrived, he bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing withchocolate in it.
But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly
happy turned up....
"Harry," said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. "What's that
thing outside your window?"
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing
in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look andsaw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big forit. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in theair, buffeted this way and that in the train's slipstream. Harry quicklypulled down the window, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It feltlike a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside. The owldropped its letter onto Harry's seat and began zooming around theircompartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing itstask. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval.Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yelloweyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm's way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, "It's from Sirius!"
"What?" said Ron and Hermione excitedly. "Read it aloud!"Dear Harry,I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don't know
whether they're used to owl post.
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won't tell you where, in case this owl
falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, buthe is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven't a366hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse
me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castlewill be lifted.
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief
meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt --
"Ha!" said Hermione triumphantly. "See! I told you it was from him!""Yes, but he hadn't jinxed it, had he?" said Ron. "Ouch!" The tiny owl,
now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in whatit seemed to think was an affectionate way.
Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name
but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault. Pleaseconsider it as thirteen birthdays' worth of presents from yourgodfather.
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that
night last year when you left your uncle's house. I had only hoped toget a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think thesight of me alarmed you.
I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next
year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.
If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.I'll write again soon.SiriusHarry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of
parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warmand contented as though he'd swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in onegulp.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter's godfather, hereby give him permission to
visit Hogsmeade on weekends.367"That'll be good enough for Dumbledore!" said Harry happily. He looked
back at Sirius's letter. "Hang on, there's a RS...."
I thought your ftiend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it's my fault
he no longer has a rat.
Ron's eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. "Keep
him?" he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a moment;then, to Harry's and Hermione's great surprise, he held him out forCrookshanks to sniff.
"What do you reckon?" Ron asked the cat. "Definitely an owl?"Crookshanks purred."That's good enough for me," said Ron happily. "He's mine."Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into
King's Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he,Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine an ('three-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing agood distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, andwhen Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions aboutthem seemed confirmed.
"I'll call about the World Cup!" Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk andHedwig's cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
"What's that?" he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still
clutching in his hand. "If it's another form for me to sign, you've gotanother ---"
"It's not," said Harry cheerfully. "It's a letter from my godfather.""Godfather?" sputtered Uncle Vernon. "You haven't got a godfather!""Yes, I have," said Harry brightly. "He was my mum and dad's best
friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prisonand he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep368up with my news... check if I'm happy..."
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon's face,
Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front ofhim, for what looked like a much better summer than the last.
