# Text Analytics Final Project: Analysis of the Harry Potter Series

### Main File

The main file (final report notebook) is named FinalReport.ipynb

### Other Files

The CORPUS table and "Cleaned.ipynb" (i.e. the notebook where I actually did most/all of the coding) were too large to be uploaded into Github, but they are located in my UVA Box file here (I am not sure how to grant access to another user in Box if it is private, but I'm assuming you will be able to access it - if not, I will find another way to send the .ipynb notebook and CORPUS table to you): https://virginia.app.box.com/folder/206358245223

The get_pdf_text.ipynb file was where PyPDF2 was used to scrape the Harry Potter PDF files from my computer.
